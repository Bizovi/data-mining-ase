# Pragmatic Data Science

This is an introductory, big picture course which bridges the gap between theory and practice, **cultivating the skills and understanding** necessary to bring value to organisations by **improving decision-making**. It is an attempt to find a golden mean of both worlds: 

- Illuminating theoretical ideas (contemplating in the library)
- Practicing battle-tested technologies (engineering in the trenches).
