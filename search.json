    "text": "Welcome to the course!\nThis is an introductory, big picture graduate course which bridges the gap between theory and practice, cultivating the skills and understanding necessary to bring value to organisations by improving decision-making. It is an attempt to find a golden mean of both worlds:\n\nIlluminating theoretical ideas (contemplating in the library)\nPracticing battle-tested technologies (engineering in the trenches).\n\n\n\nThe best advice I ever got as a novice data scientist was: “Think of youself as a business person with superpowers”. I’m attempting to reconcile that spirit of simplicity and elegance with advances in statistical thinking and engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho should read this book?\n\n\n\n\nAnyone lost, confused, stuck or overwhelmed by Data Science and Machine Learning complexities, who wants to see the big picture and the possibilities\n\nIf you stumbled upon this e-book, you’re probably a student in Business Analytics at Bucharest’ Academy of Economic Sciences – well, because I shamelessly promoted it.\nMaybe, you’re an engineer getting curious about ML or an analyst with a knack for the business, looking to improve your workflow and expand the quantitative toolbox. Maybe you’re a product manager or an entrepreneur who wants to infuse AI into your startup.\n\n\nThis is the course I wish I had when starting my journey in data science, which would prepare me for the realities of the industry, often very different from the academic world. At the same time, this is NOT a bootcamp: it is not enough by itself to land you a job, which requires lots of practice and extra study.\nTo the service of understanding, it becomes quite abstract and conceptual at times, but I hope you bear with me until you see the benefits of those abstractions. Think of it as a skeleton, a conceptual frame1 which ties together everything you have learned so far and can be built upon as you progress in your career and studies.1 This course stands on the “shoulders of giants”, and I can only aspire to get to the level of clarity and rigor provided by Hastie/Tibshirani or Andrew Ng. However, there is too much content out there, and the roadmap provided here should help you navigate it and find the shortest path towards better decisions in your firm."

    "text": "Why should you care?\nYou might’ve heard that data scientist is the sexiest job of 21st century, that AI is going to take over repetitive jobs, Deep Reinforcement Learning models are beating people at Dota and Chess, solving almost-impossible protein-folding problems. But what does it actually mean, if we step outside the hype and buzzwords, use a plain language, and apply these ideas in a more down-to-earth, day-to-day problems and challenges in businesses?\nOver the past 3 years, you’ve probably been tortured by (or enjoyed) linear algebra, mathematical analysis, probability and statistics, operations research, differential equations, mathematical economics and cybernetics, algorithms and data structures, databases, object-oriented programming, econometrics and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy study all of this?\n\n\n\nWe live in a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world,2 but we still have to make decisions. Those decisions will bring better outcomes if they are informed by understanding the causal processes, driven by evidence and robust predictions. For a more complete explanation, read here.2 VUCA: a mental model to better understand the world\nI want you to take away ONE thing, that is AI and Data Science in Businesses boils down to: Decision-Making under Uncertainty at Scale\n\n\nIt can be a function of decision-making support or the system/product itself, like in the case of Uber, Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, Google and many others. Even if you are not a data scientist, you will work with them in one form or another (Quant, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, ML Engineer, Data/BI Engineer, Decision-Maker, Domain Expert). Therefore, you have to understand their language, what are they doing, how to ask and make sure they solve the right problem for you.\n\nWhen somebody asks you what have you learned in this book and course, I suggest two metaphors:3 one of simplification and another of seeing relations3 Due to my recent philosophical readings, some of the language here has a very specific meaning, which is totally outside the scope. For the curious, I will write a few blog posts outlining some philosophical arguments which struck a chord in me and which I found tremenously useful in day-to-day life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see Pollock’s messy reality, which is the data and observations. We want to get to Picasso’s bare bones essence, for better and clearer decision-making\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a big picture course, which re-contextualizes everything you have learned before, but didn’t see how it all fits together or can it be implemented in practice to bring value to organisations, that is: be useful"

    "text": "Cybernetics Done Right\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe idea behind Cybernetics curriculum is great: an interdisciplinary approach to solving complex economic problems, that is what we know today as weak/specialised AI4.4 Or data science, if you wish – at the intersection of computer science, domain expertise (economics), statistics and mathematics. We will dive in more detail and nuance in our first lectures.\nUnfortunately, the execution is extremely difficult to pull off without a consistent vision, expertise and an account of recent developments. It is even more difficult to put those 80’s models in practice, especially in a data-driven age.\n\n\nLet’s go back to the burning question: what I wish I had in a course? It is hard to teach these topics in a way which is both theoretically sound and can be immediately applied.\nAfter recognizing that there is no silver bullet, my conclusion is that following the principles outlined below consistently, dramatically increases the chances of preparing a new generation ready to tackle the messy, ill-defined problems we encounter.\n\nProvide motivation for why something is important (a field, theory, model, method, technology)\nDiscuss practical applications and challenges the firms face, from an insider’s perspective. Those are our case-studies.\n\nFirst, we try to deeply understand the problem and frame it in “our” language, that is, clarify and reduce ambiguity\nThen, we strip the problem to the simplest model, to illuminate some key aspect, like pricing and demand planning decisions. Then, and only then we bring back all the realism and complexities.\nApplications are based on realistic or real data, which can be messy, hard to access, biased and incomplete\nCoding up the solutions and software implementations, with the real-world challenges of deploying models and improving decision making\n\nDevelop a conceptual undestanding, an intuition about the problem and the “tool” we think is appropriate in tackling it:\n\nPresent the tool theoretically rigorous and sound, but only where it matters. More geometry and graphs over equations, more simulations and stories over proofs.\nLeverage previous mathematical, statistical, and domain knowledge\nFor the mathematically inclined, add some elements of abstract math to understand the underlying foundations of these methods and models\n\nUse simulations as a safe playground 5 that we control, to get a feel for the behavior of models and algorithms.\n\nImplement those in code using best practices, as an engineering exercise\nWith lots of visualization, especially interactive ones\n\n\n5 I often find myself truly understanding something, only after I code it up and understand the “mechanics” (of a model) well, then try to think of how I would apply it in practice, in different contexts. This hints to the idea that we need some complementary background and tools, some of them right from the beginning of higher education.Speaking about the prerequisites, there are some tools we have to dust off the shelves and cultivate an appreciation of their importance: linear algebra, calculus, probability theory and mathematical statistics. Not least, a confident handle of a programming language like Python or R is essential, such that we can focus on what truly matters.\n\n\nThose prerequisites are placed in context of the business practice, with swift reviews and references to resources which should fill in all the gaps.\nAt the same time, we have to gradually get rid of the bad habits that were accumulated: analyses which can’t be reproduced, mechanically following a statistical procedure (because the flowchart of statistical tests said so, for example), jumping to a conclusion (as if there is only one, correct, textbook answer), rushing the learning process, handwaving to cover for a poorly articulated argument. On the other side of the spectrum, perfectionism doesn’t help either, as this field is inherently iterative and experimental.\nBut we need to develop a set of processes to iterate and improve effectively"

    "text": "Your Unorthodox Guide\nThink of me as an industry expert,6 not an academic pushing you to do homework. Think of the course as a summer school or workshop, rather than required credits and another exam to pass.6 \n\n\n\n\nSee one of my conference talks at BigDataWeek, intended for a mixed tech/business audience: Pragmatic AI in Google Cloud Platform\n\n\n\nI’m a generalist – navigating uncertainty and complexity to improve decision-making at scale with data and domain-driven software. Here are a few relevant facts about me:\n\nGraduate of Cybernetics (2017) and Quantitative Economics (2019)\n\nDid some research in Complex Systems, Agent-Based Modeling, Systems’ Dynamics, and Heterodox Economics, which was lots of fun\nMy serious work was at the intersection of Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning (thesis, dissertation)\n\nHead of Data Science at AdoreMe Tech, with the firm since 2016\n\nLingerie e-commerce in the U.S., with a PAYG, subscription and try-at-home business models\n$250m revenue in 2022, acquired by Victoria’s Secret\n70 tech people in Bucharest, over 300 employees\nMy work involves AI Strategy, Product Management, ML Systems Design\n\nSome typical applications of AI in an e-commerce I contributed to:7\n\nDemand Planning and Inventory Optimization systems to prevent lost sales and excess inventory\nRecommender Systems to help users find relevant, personalized items and bundles\nMarketing optimizations in Acquisition/Advertisement, Engagement, CRM, Merchandising, Pricing and Promotion\n\nHobbies:\n\nReading about “Philosophy as a Way of Life” & Cognitive Science\nPainting, Hiking, Jazz/Classical/Metal\nPlayed chess professionally, but that much stress isn’t worth it\n\n\n7 I find the idea of “Skin in the Game” very appealing. Therefore, a lot of attention will be given to the pitfalls, what can go wrong and what I learned from past mistakes, so that you don’t have to repeat them.Unfortunately, I have none of the answers of how does Intelligence, Rationality, Wisdom contribute to meaning in life – at best, some plausible hypotheses\nUnsurprisingly, there will be lots of painting metaphors when it comes to simplicity, and cognitive science references when talking about ways in which we’re biased and foolish. Chess, of course, inspires analogies of competition, strategy, and tactics to its service.\nYou have to know that my concerns are related to a synoptic integration of different fields and perspectives over an incremental contribution in a narrow domain. To show how that could be applied in articulating a philosophy for life, here’s a deeply personal diagram8 which emphasises how these different interests fit into a coherent whole.8 \n\n\n\n\nEach of these interests and areas have an aspect of “science”, craft, worldview, and deep participation / engagement\n\n\n\nI can’t emphasise enough the importance of different levels to “knowing”: propositional, procedural, perspectival, and participatory – as it is not enough to know the facts (or have beliefs), but to know how to do something, to have a perspective of the “world” and a sense of participation in whatever you’re engaged in. I mean that we’re agents in different arenas of life, and the sense of meaning comes from an attunement to those arenas. We participate in a course of something, which has impact on the environment, which changes us and how we view and relate to the world, self and others."

    "text": "Course Roadmap\nWe start the course with a first module, in which we explore the context of data science in businesses, figure out what does AI mean, and where is it useful. Then, we review important statisical concepts and tools, exapting/repurposing them for our objectives, while remembering the hell we needed those in the first place.\nNext, we move on to A/B testing and towards a mindset of causal inference. Once you get a taste of decisions with high stakes, we switch to a predictive, Machine Learning perspective and walk through our workhorse models, which should serve us decades ahead in a wide range of applications: both predictive and exploratory.\nDid you get comfortable with ML? Good, because it’s time to acknowledge the limitations and get more powerful tools from causal inference, when A/B tests and randomised experiments are unfeasible or unethical, but we can leverage naturally-occuring experiments. This is truly challenging: it is an art and science, in contrast with the auto-magic pattern recognition of ML. It requires deep thinking and understanding.\nThe icing on the cake is miscellaneous topics dear to me and usually not covered in such a course: Demand Forecasting, Recommender Systems, and Natural Language Processing. All extremely useful in business contexts, but significant tweaks are needed to the models discussed before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  DSc(Decision-Making Under Uncertainty at Scale) -- understanding  --> Stat(Stat Fundamentals) \n  DSc -- business context  --> VUCA[V.U.C.A.] --> App(Applications) --> R[Role in firms] --> PML(ML Process) --> PS(Stat process)\n  Stat --> Prob(Probability) --> Es(Estimators) --> Boot(Bootstrap) --> AB(A/B Testing) -- optional --> ExpD[/Causality/]\n\n  DSc -- skills/labs  --> Eng(Engineering) --> Data(Data Wrangling) --> Repr[Reproducibility] --> Pipe(Pipelines) -- advanced --> FS[/Full Stack Apps/]\n  ML --> Class(Bayes Classifiers) --> GLM(GLMs) --> T(Tree-based Ensembles) -- advanced --> Caus(Hierarchical Models) --> Misc[/Time Series and Misc/]\n\n  DSc -- workhorse models  --> ML(Statistical Learning) --> Unsup(Dimensionality Reduction) --> Clust(Clustering) -- optional --> RS[/RecSys/] --> Text[/NLP Embeddings/]\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Don’t let the sheer diversity and breadth of topics intimidate you, as we’ll go step by step through each aspect, explaining the why and how.

It sounds complicated, but we have the tools to make it easy for us. Don’t worry about getting everything right, but focus on a problem and single area from the course you’re passionate about: be it data visualization, ML, statistics or sheer engineering curiosity."

    "text": "Data Science in the Wild\nAt this point, you might get tired of me emphasizing the decision-making aspect of data science as the main point of why it is important. It’s time we move from the general and abstact towards particular examples and applications in various industries. This will lead us to acknowledge how prevalent is AI (that we haven’t fully defined yet) in firms, services and technologies we use every day. 77 When reading this section, I want to get you into a mindset of the reverse engineer: step back and think deeply about products and services you use every day, put yourself in the shoes of the business making those decisions and building those systems. What were they thinking about? What challenges were they facing that were an appropriate use-case for ML, Statistics, and AI?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a lecture, I usually ask students\n\n\n\nCan you give some examples of businesses, sevices, technologies, problems, and domains which you suspect do have AI/ML algorithms and models behind the scenes?\nSee below some very good answers and argumentations provided by the students last year, then we’ll examine in more details one of them. Of course, there is always that one person, very passionate about sports or blockchain.\n\n\n\nDynamic pricing in Bolt and Uber, which takes into account the weather, especially if it rains, peak hours: balancing demand and supply. It is at the intersection of ML and economic theory, as they are a platform or marketplace. Prices also change with respect to competitors, so we see aspects of an oligopoly behavior. 8\n\nStock markets and trading bots: at the intersection of economics, finance and AI. I would add the “good old” and boring portfolio management and venture capital enterprises.\nManagement consulting: what market to enter, whether and how to build a new product (product development). Lots of use-cases in marketing and market research firms.\nMedicine Applications: developing new vaccines and drugs, aided by AI and designing clinical trials for novel treatments.\nBanks and insurance: risk management, predicting credit defaults on mortgages and business loans. Chatbots for customer support, for most frequent and simple questions.\nAutomotive: routine tasks like automated parking, the race towards self-driving, autonomous or semi-autonomous cars, safety warnings. Predictive maintainance is tackling a problem where they leverage predictions to replace risky parts before they go out of function.\nLiverpool F.C. won a title, and a key part of their success was leveraging AI and ML to discover new tactis on the field with the highest payoffs. 9\nNBA teams invested a lot in the data infrastructure and decision-making capabilities: LA Lakers found the best player at the moment for a particular position they were lacking and would play well along with the team. Rockets won the regular championship divison by going all in on the 3-point shot.10 Golden State Warriors simply revolutionised basketball with data, before everyone else was doing it – giving them a competitive edge. 11\n\n8 When it doesn’t work out – I’m pretty upset at their data scientists and domain experts. Here is where ethical issues creep up: jacking up prices, monopolies, drivers struggling to make a living wage.9 TODO: Reference article and maybe dataset for more details10 Moreyball: The Houston Rockets and Analytics – an article in Harvard’s MBA Digital Innovation11 Check out the following video by The Economist on how data transformed the NBA. For more details on the statistical methodology, I enjoyed an youtube channel called Thinking Basketball and their playlist about the statistical methodology.In all of the examples above, those businesses and systems do have to make decisions, under uncertainty from multiple sources, trying to solve complex problems at a large scale, which would be impossible to do manually even with an army of employees.\nI would like to add a few more examples, from an insider and practitioner’s perspective, which might not be as impressive and a bit routine, but no less important. Keep in mind, that if at a closer look, the service seems to do something relatively intelligent very fast, specialized AI might be involved behind the scenes.\n\nDemand Planning: How many SKUs (items) should I order for manufacturing, to satisfy the demand (that last item on the shelf, minimizing lost sales) and to minimize excess inventory.\nLogistics and Supply Chain: routing, distribution center operations and automations for order fulfillment, return management\nRecommender systems for music, videos, books, products, news in social media, services, platforms, and e-commerces like facebook, instagram, tiktok, youtube, spotify, amazon, emag. You can find recommendations in surprising places, like google maps.\nProgrammatic Advertisement: finding best placement for ads on various platforms, right now dominated by meta and google\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the Case Studies for a Deeper Understanding\n\n\n\nWe will explore some challenges and applications from this list in a series of case studies and labs. The idea is to improve our ability to identify opportunities and formulate problems from the point of view of an organisation, such that we can match those with the methods, models and algorithms discussed in the course.\nI’ll have to introduce a lot of new concepts when the language we developed so far will turn out to be insufficient to talk about and understand what’s happening inside these firms. Thus, each case study is an opportunity to play around with a novel idea. 1212 If you have a pretty good idea about what is AI, Analytics, ML, Deep Learning, Big Data, Causal Inference and when to use one approach or another, feel free to skip the history and terminology and go straight to the case studies.\n\nIn the first deep-dive, we will look at Uber and Bolt, with publicly available information, trying to figure out what do their data scientists do.\nThen, we will look at the lingerie e-commerce where I work at, AdoreMe and a different set of problems we’re facing."

Data science is an umbrella term, with interdisciplinary at its core, drawing inspiration from multiple fields, sets of tools, practices, methods and it continuously evolves. 13 It is designed to help us tackle increasingly more complicated problems at a large scale. There is also a reasonable worry about ways in which these systems can go wrong or awry.13 There are many questions still unanswered: How does this landscape of Data Science look like? What are the roles and jobs? What is the process for building smarter, data-driven software systems; drawing more reliable inferences and conclusions from data and theory? How does a day in data scientist’s life look like?\nYou will often see a Venn diagram where data science sits at the intersection of mathematics – statistics, computer science – software engineering, and domain knowledge. I think this is not sufficient to characterise data science, therefore, will try to elaborate what it does, and how (which is as important).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI in a Nutshell\n\n\n\nFor all pragmatic intents and purposes, especially in businesses, AI is about Decision-Making under Uncertainty at Scale 14.14 C. Kozyrkov - AI is decision-making at scale\nOne important keyword here is uncertainty, as there is no point in building AI solutions based on complex models if we don’t have uncertainty. We have to be able to change our mind and actions in the face of evidence.\nOn the other hand, scale is the reason ML and Deep Learning is so powerful, because you can take lots of small decisions in an automated way, with little curation or guidance from humans. This is why many traditionally “paperwork” industried like legal and accounting embrace digitalisation and automation now.\n\n\nUltimately, why would I build a system which predicts demand for products in a direct-to-consumer ecommerce like Allbirds, Macy’s, or AdoreMe? Either in a marketplace like Emag or Amazon? Why would I try to find out the factors which contribute to a successful advertisement?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some answers from students\n\n\n\n\nIn order to allocate resources to the stuff which generates growth and profit. Avoid being scattered around (which I would call bad strategy), resulting in costs over targets and inefficiency.\nIn short, we attempt to allocate resources and efforts efficiently.\nWe can view information as a competitive advantage, anticipating and predicting so that we can plan and prepare, outperform competitors.\n\n\n\nWhen we talk about uncertainty, it’s important to recognize its sources: 15 one coming from incomplete information, that we always work with samples in one way or another. For example, even if at a certain point in time we might have real-time data, everything evolves and quickly becomes outdated. Everything is in a state of flux and change. Even in the current state, we don’t know for sure where we stand – sometimes, in economics, this problem is called nowcasting. When talking about the future, making a good prediction is one of the most difficult things.15 We will talk more formally about sources of uncertainty in the next lecture, while reviewing the fundamentals of statistics.\nFor example, who would’ve predicted the pandemic and all its implications on the supply chain and society? It’s important to note the difference between this kind of black swan events and the irreducible, fundamental uncertainty, which can’t be captured by any explanatory factors.\nIn a happy case, we can quantify and reduce it by conditioning the model, that is, joint distribution of random variables with a given structure, on data. That would result in inferences and evidence with respect to our hypothesis and model of the world.16 At the very least we can try to quantify how uncertain are we.16 We want to say something intelligent about the population, technically, to generalize. However, there is ambiguity, as objectives and the meaning/semantics of data fields are not always mathematically clear or without conflict.\nSo, we still have to make decisions. Those have to have a level of robustness and resilience to shocks, in the face of uncertainty. I would go even further, to suggest that we should aim for antifragility, meaning, the system improves after a shock or negative event, but that is very hard to implement and operationalize, therefore, it falls outside the scope of this course – to the realm of systems’ design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you don’t need AI and Statistics\n\n\n\nAs a though experiment, itmagine we have an equation or program, with well-defined rules, which perfectly predicts the price on stock markets, or perfectly predicts how many items will a client buy and how she will respond if we change the price (an intervention). We won’t need machine learning, causal inference, or AI there.\nOf course, we don’t have that kind of program. It’s only somewhat true in cases when we have a well-tested theory, which stood the test of time and went through the scientific process to become the best theory with respect to all others. For example newtonian physics, relativity, quantum mechanics, evolution.\n\n\nHowever, when we talk about human behavior, we should resist the temptation and arrogance to say that we have a well-defined theory, be it normative or positive. Our preferences change, and we can “decide” in which direction they change or persist.\nRegardless of the business we work at or own, the place in the value chain, we’ll have to deal with human behavior: customers, employees, decision-makers, engineers. We need other kind of tools to infer perceptible regularities and patterns in their behavior. We will be forced in one way or another to learn from data and observation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA model is a simplified representation of reality\n\n\n\nWe need models to make sense of the world around us, because it is so complex and uncomprehensible if we are to represent it faithfully in a simulation. Therefore, we focus on relevant, interestig, essential aspects to us, we simplify by baking in domain knowledge, assumptions, and data into the models and algorithms.\nSo, we can collect data, apply algorithms to train models, in order to make inferences about some relevant quantities. That will help us in making evidence-based decisions which gets us closer to our objective in an efficient way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak AI is Domain-Specific\n\n\n\nBy now, you probably figured out that we’re not talking about General AI, trying to surpass human intelligence in general reasoning and problem-solving. Thus, we’re talking about weak or specialized AI, which depends very much on the domain.\nAI in an a fashion e-commerce, like AdoreMe, where we sell lingerie, will have a very different flavor from the tools and methods used in genomics, medicine, social science or psychology.\nDespite the fact that there are a lot of shared fundamentals, when it comes to the principles of building models, it is not straightforward to take something which works in one domain and apply it in another. Significant tweaks and adaptations are needed, which are dependent on the specificities of that domain.\nThe good news is that when these transdisciplinary groups of people work together and successfully adapt a method, it is often a breakthrough in the field borrowing the theory and technology.\n\n\n\nCybernetics is what we call AI\nAt this point we have a working definition of Weak AI. At a first glance it might be hard to see what does it have in common with Cybernetics and its study of Complex Adaptive Systems.\nI’m not trying to equivocate those two, but argue that weak AI is how Cybernetics evolved and is mostly used in practice now. I will give a definition from P. Novikov, which I found tremendously useful, then explain it. Can you spot the parallels of “decision-making under uncertainty at scale” in this definition?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA better definition of Cybernetics\n\n\n\nThe science of general regularities of control and information processing in animal, machine and human (socitey)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnpacking this dense/abstract definition\n\n\n\n\nControl means goal-directedness, the ability to reach the goals and objectives by taking action and stirring the system towards a trajectory. The objective can also be perserving the structural-functional organization of the system itself, an autopoesis.\nInformation Processing could be pattern recoginition, perception, how you understand and model the world, what inferences do you draw, what “data inputs” are used\nGeneral regularities means what is true and plausible of control and information processing across fields and a variety of complex systems, not only in particular cases.\nAnimal refers to applications in biology, machine – in engineering, and human – in our society and behavior.\n\nIn economic cybernetics, we’re concerned with economics, society and human behavior, rather than engineering, biology, or natural science applications.\n\n\nTo explain how Cybernetics evolved into Weak AI, there is a conglomeration of fields which went a bit out of fashion and favor: Game Theory, General Systems’ Theory, Agent-Based Modeling, Systems’ Dynamics, Complexity and Chaos, Evolutionary Algorithms. This stuff is fascinating and inspired many other breakthroughs, but it is extremely difficult to implement in practice.\nSo, we kind of settled on a more pragmatic set of tools, which is dominated pattern recognition and optimisation, in one form or another trying to learn from data (ML, DL, Causality) and act optimally (Dynamic Programming, Reinforcement Learning). .\nWait. What’s going on here? Am I saying that we did a bachelor’s degree in AI under the term of Economic Cybernetics? For me, personally, after having this epiphany – everything I studied makes so much more sense in retrospective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe meaning of AI changed in the meanwhile\n\n\n\nYou can make sense of the terminology and general confusion of terms, by reading M. I. Jordan’s brilliant article 17, which tells the history of “AI” and how this confusion arose. He also points out how many of the claims in the field, as of today are a stretch (i.e. the revolution hasn’t happened yet) 18.17 K. Pretz - Stop Calling Everything AI, Machine-Learning Pioneer Says18 M. Jordan - Artificial Intelligence: The Revolution Hasn’t Happened Yet\nI highly encourage you to read the articles by M. Jordan, but until then, here are a few ways people understand AI:\n\nCybernetics and Weak AI, which we discussed before\nGeneral AI is a titanic project. It interweaves with Philosophy, Cognitive Science, in order to understand what makes us intelligent and conscious. On the other hand, trying to build general-purpose problem solving machines.\nSymbolic AI, is still relevant in a few niches, especially in automated proofs and logical reasoning.\nAugmentative AI, like VR, augmenting human capabilities, human-machine interactions\n\n\n\nIn practice, if you’re a data/business analyst, ML/data engineer, data scientist, statistician, product manager – Cybernetics is a way of thinking in systems and formulate problems well. When it comes to implementation, we mostly use data and the tools, models, methods discussed in this course."

    "text": "Analytics, ML or Statistics?\nAt this point, you should have a pretty good idea why data science is important, what are some possible applications and domains, what does it do and concerned about. It is the motivation, real-world use-cases, and conceptual understanding that I promised at the beginning of the course.\nDisentangling the ambiguity around AI was one of the most difficult aspects of the course to articulate. Now, it’s time to transition to a lower level of analysis (inside data science, not outside it), break down the landscape into manageable chunks and develop our toolbox, in which we learn how to formulate problems well and match them with existing models, methods, and technologies.\nOne of the first tools I want to introduce, is distinguishing three ways of thinking, which have to work harmoniously together, in order for a data science project to be successful:\n\nAnalytics and Data Mining, where the main goal is formulating better research questions and hypotheses, that is, get inspiration, find interesting and relevant patterns and relationships in massive datasets\nMachine Learning, as a way to use training algorithms to go automatically from experience (data) to expertise (a program or recipe for prediction). Put in other words, learning from data, finding invariants, patterns which generalize beyond our sample and training data.\nCausal Inference 19 for making decisions with high stakes, where we have to understand the causal processes of the system in order to intervene optimally. It enables greater transparency, reliability, and rigor in the inferences and conclusions drawn.\n\n19 I find that statistics is not the right term here, as it is too broad, especially recently when the lines between ML and Stats are getting more blurry, as one adopts methods from other.\n\n\n\n\nSource: xkcd; Which one to choose and when? We will have some unlearning to do here, as much of the previous courses were in one way or another focused on analytics. Even in statistics or econometrics, there is little from the field of causality, which is necessary to apply it to real-world challenges. On the other hand, you applied ML methods, but in my opinion, without understanding what ML is, without a rigorous process which would ensure we don’t overfit or snoop the data, without a clear plan of how to deploy it to production and make decisions based on those predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe art of formulating a hypothesis\n\n\n\nIn many intro to statistics or science courses, we take for granted the hypothesis, it is often our starting point. How does one come up with a business or scientific hypothesis with makes sense, is reasonable, plausible, deserves serious consideration? Since there are an infinity of possible ones, how do we pick the most relevant?\nI argue, it is an art which requires a kind of intuition, sensibility, and attunement to the problem. In my opinion, it is the most underrated aspect of scientific enquiry and process: a good problem formulation often gets us halfway towards a solution.\nIn this course we focus on data mining and analytics as a way to get inspiration for good questions to ask and hypotheses to formulate. However, in anthropology or evolutionary biology, it could be done by careful observation of the behavior, coupled with a deep understanding of the field, existing theories and their shortcomings and inconsistencies. Often, these hypotheses follow as a consequence from the theory itself.\n\n\nIf we don’t have to make decisions and want to find interesting patterns in data, to inform our future questions, we have lots of methods for exploratory data analysis – from visualization (manual) to clustering (automated) and model-driven exploration. Sometimes, we just want to monitor and display the facts and current state of a business on a dashboard – this is why your previous class was on BI (Business Intelligence).\nThen, in the decision-making processs, these questions and hypotheses can be communicated to statisticians and decision-makers, so that they have a clearer direction and more promising candidates to experiment with. This doesn’t mean that what we found the causal process which makes some clients more profitable than others, when we notice a difference between groups or clusters of clients.\nIf we do have to make a few, high-stakes, strategic decisions of major importance to business outcomes and user experience, that means we need some rigorous statistics. For example, how to price the products, whether to enter a new market, what products to develop, how to allocate advertisement spending across different platforms, whether to deploy a new recommender system. We will discuss at length what can go wrong in drawing conclusions from data alone (with analytics or ML), and how that can backfire spectacularly.\nIf we have to make lots of decisions at scale and high frequency, for example – doing demand forecasting and inventory optimization for 100k product SKUs, it cannot be done manually or with carefully designed experiments. In this case, an appropriate choice would be to learn from data and get predictions as reliable as possible. Keep in mind, that we will have to be very careful when defining what the model is optimizing for – it has to be aligned with business objectives.\nWhy ML, since we put so much emphasis onto scientific rigor and trying to infer the causal processes? Sometimes – you don’t have a theory. For example, in recommender systems it’s just too complicated, with so many heterogenous users and items, each with their specific preferences and idiosyncracies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy not use all at various stages of a project?\n\n\n\nIt is not a debate of which one is better: ML vs Stats vs Analytics. One has to cycle through these approaches, gain greater understanding, experience, and skill in order to use the appropriate tools in the right context.\nI recommend the following 4-part presentation 20 by Cassie Kozyrkov, so that you get a good idea of how AI fits into organization and decision-making process. I recommend following her and, basically reading everything she has written on medium.20 C.Kozyrkov - Making Friends with Machine Learning\n\n\nPay close attention to the process of developing data-driven products 21 and what are the prerequisites for an AI project to be successful (or doomed from the very start). It is important not to skip the relevant steps, understand the roles of people involved: from decision-makers, to statisticians, and data engineers. A good blueprint 22 for thinking about how to define and plan an AI project is given by Google’s PAIR (People and AI Research group). We will discuss all of this in detail during our next lectures and case studies.21 C.Kozyrkov - 12 Steps to Applied AI22 People and AI Research | Google - Guidebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre we in the business of ML?\n\n\n\nThe next two questions are tremendously important and will prevent you from embarking on an AI project which is doomed from the start:\n\nIs there a value proposition for AI? In other words, is there an underlying pattern to be discuvered?\nDo I have the (necessary and relevant) data?\n\nIf yes and yes, we MIGHT be in business! But we shall not forget about the pragmatic aspects: is it feasible to be done with a small team, without a huge investment? What is the simplest way we can solve it? Are we solving the right problem? Are we making the job of people in the firm easier and more efficient?\n\n\nMake no mistake, the data science field is fascinating and full of exciting applications, but as you well know from statistics, there are numerous pitfalls we can fall into. I think it is useful to demistify AI and get humble, down to earth about what it can and can’t do – its power, but also the limitations:\n\nJust take a look at how many AI tools have been built to catch covid, and none helped 23\nOne part of the problem is the mismatch between the real/business problem and objectives, versus what models optimize for. Vincent Warmerdam brilliantly explains it in “The profession of solving the wrong problem”24 and “How to constrain artificial stupidity” 25.\n\n23 W.Heaven - Hundreds of AI tools have been built to catch covid. None of them helped.24 V. Warmerdam - The profession of solving the wrong problem25 V. Warmerdam - How to Constrain Artificial Stupidity\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit your damn data! (on data snooping)\n\n\n\nSince we’re engaging in the business of data mining and analytics at one point or another of the project, we have to be extra careful. Intuitively, you understand that discovering hypotheses and testing them on the same set of data is a bad idea, because we’ll get an overly confident estimation of how good it is.\nHowever, sometimes, we don’t shy away from doing an exploratory data analysis, finding relevant and predictive features for our target variable by trying out a few models. Next day, we forget about this, having the conclusions crystalized in our mind, and apply a new, final model … on the same data. Often we get away with this, but it is as bad, meaning equivalent to the first case – we contaminated the data with our mining.\nSo, before we get into the nuances of model validation, selection, and experiment design, get into the habit of always splitting your data. Give that test dataset to a friend, locked under a key and don’t let her give you that data, until you have your final model to be deployed and used for decisions.\n\n\nWhy go through all of that pain to critique our own model with such a vigor? The answer is simple – if it passes this rigorous critique, it has greater chance of finding a real/causal pattern and generalize to examples outside our sample.\nThis is a lot to take in! But there is one more thing to explore – there is one course by Dr. Adam Fleischhacker 26, which has a very similar philosophy, but is much more established and thought out, with many practical examples. Here is what he has to say in the course intro:26 Adam Fleischhacker - Introduction to Business Analytics: Intro to Bayesian Business Analytics in the R Eco-System\n\n“You will translate real-world scenarios into both mathematical and computational representations that yield actionable insight. You will then take that insight back to the real-world to persuade stakeholders to alter and improve their real-world decisions.”\n\nDr. Fleischhacker makes an illuminating distinction between the business analyst’s workflow and a machine learning workflow, and sets up the normative criteria which make it successful. In our course, his workflow falls under the discussions related to causal inference. One interesting thing to note, is the convergence in the approach of an extremely diverse set of people: Cassie Kozyrkov, Vincent Warmerdam, Adam Fleischhacker, Richard McElreath, Andrew Ng – all coming from different backgrounds and activating in different environments and domains.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: causact.com; “(The workflow) starts with strategy, expertise, and data as inputs and results in the business analyst leading their firms to act on value-adding insights”\n\n\nLet’s briefly review those normative criteria of this workflow. It might be a confirmation bias on my part, but the fact that these are present in the current course in one way or another, means I stumbled upon them by trial-and-error and painful mistakes:\n\nOutcome-focused: What is the point of fancy models, if we don’t achieve good or desired outcomes? If I was implying it so far, for the rest of the course we’ll ask this explicitly every time we tackle a business problem.\nStrategically-aligned: “Not all outcomes are created equal. Companies seeking to capture market share might increase expenses to aid market capture. Companies seeking to be cost leaders might leave some customers unsatisifed to keep expenses low. So a one-size-fits-all approach to defining good outcomes is ill-advised.”\nAction-oriented: We insisted so much on insights influencing, driving actions and decisions that there is little to add here. The remaining question is how can we communicate and articulate it well to convince decision-makers and stakeholders.\nComputationally Rigorous: Refers to the know-how, the engineering in the trenches. Even though we’ll spend most of the time in the frequentist land – I think the future is at the intersection of Causality and Bayesian Inference.\n\nTaking it one step further, this kind of workflow should be reproducible and (mostly) automated. This is why we’ll explore an ecosystem of software engineering tools and practices in the labs.\nIdeally, given in the hands of our clients/users in form of a full stack data app. This is where we take off our consulting hat and start building software products.\n\n\nThis is in contrast with a predictive, machine learning workflow, which we called before “workhorse models”, a “hammer” for which everything is a nail. We got a taste of its power and limitations, and tried to articulate which are appropriate applications for ML. This course gives equal attention to ML and Causality, due to the prevalence of use-cases from which we can learn from data to make tons of decisions at scale and high frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: causact.com; “The machine learning analyst transforms historical data with known outcomes into future outcome predictions.”"

On the other hand, what is intellectually fascinating, but not at all straightforward to apply. What is a minimal or most powerful set of the prerequisites that you need?\nLet’s draw a map, stop at each field and in a sentence explain why we learned it and how it contributes to AI, Data Science, and ML.

Some are more useful in analytics, some in ML and some in making causal inferences, that is, based on data + theory.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Algebra is a language of data. The vast majority of models and training algorithms can be reduced to operations on matrices. Therefore, it is not a coincidence that is almost the only tool we have, in order to take these models and implement them in code, on a computer.\n\nMy perspective over linear algebra is ultimately computational and geometric, in the sense of the “space” the data points live in and the transformations of that space.\nUltimately, no matter the data type: image, video, text, voice, structured, panel – all can be represented as multidimensional arrays (or tensors, if you wish).\n\nMathematical Analysis is all about change, formalizing how a function behaves with respect to its arguments and parameters. It is an essential building block in optimization and deep learning (automated differentiation).\n\nI would argue that in order to understand any complex system, be it a firm, an economy, the climate or environnment, we have to model how it evolves in time.\nThis suggests the importance of differential equations and systems dynamics, modeling the feedback loops. All of this would be impossible to reason about without the mathematical analysis.\n\nProbability and Statistics is the language of uncertainty, the only instrument we have, that allows us to say something intelligent about how confident are we.\n\nWe will explore the role of statistics at lenght, but as a quote, think of it as a tool which enables us to change our mind and decisions in the face of evidence.\n\nEconometrics, in my personal opinion, tries to separate the signal for the noise and make inferences about the causal processes in economic decisions and phenomena. It specializes statistics in the domain of economics, by infusing economic theory – because you can’t derive a scientific theory from data alone.\n\nTime Series Analysis, senso largo, bridges the gap between Systems Dynamics (which takes a more theoretical perspective) with statistics and probability (stochastic processes). It adapts those tools to make inferences and predictions about phenomena which evolves in time, that are dynamic in their nature.\n\nI like the metaphor of Data Assimilation, which is actually an entire field trying to introduce the empirical dimension to differential equations.\n\nOperations Research is about optimization with constraints and efficiency. However, the problem is that often, we start from an Integer/Linear Programming problem formulation, and that is easy part – to apply an existing algorithm. The hard part is to reduce a messy real world problem at a large scale to that formulation, especially under uncertainty and nonlinearity.\nEconomics touches upon a wide range of aspects of our society and human behavior. In mathematically-oriented courses, you can think of it as optimization with constraints, the constraints being given by our positive or normative theory of economic decision-making.\n\nIn this course and in practice, we care more about business economics. It’s a very different beast from theoretical ideas in macroeconomics (ISLM, DSGE type of models) or microeconomic utilitarianism.\nBy business economics, we mean marketing, management, corporate finance, decision theory, supply chain, and logistics.\nWhat you have to know about marketing, especially if you are skeptical like me, is that it became innovative, mathematical, rigorous and data-driven. Look at any marketing journal: how much econometrics and ML models are in there.\nSo, if you hold the opinion that marketing and management are fields full of fluff – I advise you to rethink your positions. In the context of tech firms, you can’t bullshit your way through it.\nMoreover, when you combine marketing with behavioral economics and psychology, it introduces another layer of nuance and understanding over our decision-making.\nWhen we make decisions, we like to think of ourselfs as objective, but we have lots of biases and blind spots which prevent us to see the reality clearly. We often find patterns and regularities which are just noise, not causal. So, the usefulness of this kind of domain knowledge from economics about human behavior helps us to be wiser, that is, to prevent self-deception and self-sabotage towards achieving the goals and objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA word of encouragement\n\n\n\nNone of those courses were useless. Think of how can we take parts from each of those prerequisites, which are relevant in ML/DSc, so that we have more tools to solve problems of the complexity we encounter. To reiterate, data science is an umbrella term, borrowing from them all."

    "text": "Implicit Learning, Intuition and Bias\nIn the last two sections of this lecture I felt it is necessary to raise two more warning tales, precisely because we will work with such a powerful machinery and attempt to tackle complex problems in our jobs and lives.\nA good metaphor for what we’re doing in this course is the way people learn. In a way we’re pattern recognition machines, with a powerful capacity for implicit learning, meaning we can’t articulate or explain how we did it. For example, riding a bike, catching a baseball, speaking, reading and writing, behaving in social situations and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplicit Learning of Artificial Grammars\n\n\n\nThere is a famous experiment, in which researchers invented words from two languages, meaning two set of rules,27 let’s say between 3 and 8 characters, with appropriate vowels and so on. Total gibberish, but here we are, with two sets of words.27 For the curious, they used a Markov Chain artificial grammar, which would be pretty straightforward to implement in R, and is a way of looking at the language which brought the first breakthroughs in NLP (natural language processing)\nParticipants saw the lists and they had to say from what “language” does a word come from. It is a good example of experiment design coming from cognitive science research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: John Kihlstrom; They found that subjects differentiated them much better than chance and the results were statistically significant. During the interviews, when asked to explain how they did it, the responses were either “no idea”, or giving some rules, which when implemented on a computer, were not able to perform better than a coin flip.\n\n\nFollowing the experiment, this means that those rules articulated by the people in the experiment were NOT how they were thinking. There is something going on which can’t really be articulated. This means that we have a capacity to find patterns and regularities in the real world, due to evolution building into us this powerful machinery of implicit learning.\nAnother hypothesis about how animals learn is the idea that some prior 28 knowledge or mechanism – which is there due to evolution optimizing for fittedness, is necessary to kickstart the process. The discussion about the fascinating interaction between nature and nurture is outside the scope of the point I’m trying to make right now. So, here we go with two more experiments:28 We will go into more technical details when discussing Statistical Learning and ML models, of why is it the case that biasing a learning process with prior information is essential to successful learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBait Shyness – Rats Learning to Avoid Poisonous Baits\n\n\n\nWhen rats stumble upon food with new smell or look, they first eat very small amounts. If they got sick, that novel food is likely to be associated with illness, and in the future the rat will avoid it. Quoting Dr. Shai-Ben David:\n\nClearly, there is a learning mechanism in play here – the animal used past experience with some food to acquire expertise in detecting the safety of this food. If past experience with the food was negatively labeled, the animal predicts that it will also have a negative effect when encountered in the future. 2929 Shai-Ben David - Understanding Machine Learning, 2014\n\n\n\nThe bait shyness is an example of learning, not just rote memorization. More exactly of a basic inductive reasoning, or in a more statistical language, of generalization from a sample. But we intuitively know, that when generalizing a pattern, regularity is sometimes error prone: we pick up on noise, spurious correlations instead of signal, we’re fooled by randomness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB.F. Skinner: Pigeon Superstition\n\n\n\nIn an experiment, B.F. Skinner put a bunch of hungry pigeons in a cage and gave them food at random intervals via an automated mechanism. They were doing something when the food was first delivered, like turning around or pecking – which reinforced that behavior.\nTherefore, they spent more time doing that exact same thing, without regard with the chances of those actions getting them more food. That is a minimal example of superstition, a topic on which philosophers spilled so much ink.\n\n\nShai-Ben David goes on to argue – what stands at the foundations of Machine Learning, are carefully formulated principles which will prevent our automated learners, who don’t have a common sense like us, to reach these foolish and superstitious conclusions. 3030 \n\n\n\n\nSource: skewsme; Here’s Skinner’s pigeon chambers\n\n\n\nWhat is the common thread among these three stories about learining? In a nutshell, it’s about cultivating the wisdom and ablility to differentiate between correlational and causal patterns.\n\nWhen all goes well we call it intelligence, intuition, a business knack. It’s our pattern recognition picking up on some real, causal regularities. It’s the common sense working as it is supposed to.\nWhen learning goes awry, it’s a bias and in worst cases – bigoted prejudice.\nI am not a fan of how behavioral economics treats biases, 31 but here are a few so prevalent and harmful outside their intended evolutionary purpose, that we have to mention them: confirmation bias, recency, selection, various discounting biases.\nWe attribute a causal explanation to a phenomena when it’s not. For example, size of the wedding to a long-lasting marriage, extroversion and attractiveness with competence, how religious are people vs years of life.\nThere are numerous examples, and I don’t have to repeat that correlation doesn’t imply causation, due to common causes, hidden variables, mediators, reverse causes and confounders.\n\n31 The reasons come from cutting-edge Cognitive Science research, which challenge the normative position of economic rationality. Moreover, they challenge the economic orthodoxy when it comes to rationality – it is a much more complex beast than a maximisation of expected utility.So, what can we do as individuals and professionals? I think one way to get wiser is to cultivate a kind of active open-mindedness, which tries to scan for those biases and bring them into our awareness, such that we can correct our beliefs, behavior and decisions. Another thing we can do is to update our beliefs often, in the face of new evidence, keeping a scout mindset, trying to see clearly, instead of getting too attached and invested in our beliefs and positions.\nI think we’re extremely lucky to be in a field like data science, where we can use formal tools from probability, causal inference, machine learning, optimization, combined with large amounts of data and domain expertise – in order to practice that kind of a mindset. However, let’s keep in mind how easy researchers are getting fooled, not only by randomness, and that we’ll never be immune to misjudgement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe double edged sword of our intelligence\n\n\n\nThe same machinery which makes us intelligent general problem solvers and extraordinarily adaptable, makes us prone, vulnerable to bullshit and self-deceptive, self-destructive behavior.\nIt is the same, in a more techincal sense, with overfitting ML models and drawing wrong inferences. In business settings, I believe that firms will realize and appreciate that a decison scientist has this exact role – to help others rationally pursue their goals and strategy."

    "text": "Calling Bullshit in the age of Big Data\nYou probably noticed that I used the word bullshit a few times in this lecture. It is not a pejorative, but a technical/formal term introduced by Harry Frankfurt in his essay “on Bullshit”. In romanian, the closest equivalent would be “vrăjeală”, a kind of sophistry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe critical difference between Lie and Bullshit\n\n\n\nA liar functions on respect for the truth, as he inverts parts of a partially true story to convince you of a different conclusion. It is interesting that we can’t really lie to ouselfs, we kind of know it’s a lie – so we do the other, we distract our attention away from it.\nIn Bullshit, you try to convince someone of something without regard for the truth. You distract their attention, drown them in irrelevant, but supersalient stuff.\n\n\nIn our age, BS is much more sophisticated than the “good old” advertisement trying to manipulate you to buy something. I can’t recommend enough that you watch the lectures by Carl T. Bergstrom and Javin West,32 where they explain at length numerous ways we’re being convinced by bullshit arguments, but which are quantitative and have lots of jargon and pretty charts in them.32 Carl T. Bergstrom and Javin West - Calling Bullshit: The art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World\nThe kind of intimidating jargon comes from finance people, economists, when explaining why interest rates were risen, what happened in 2007-2008 great financial crisis. My “favorite” is cryptocurrency-related sophistry and some particular CEOs expertly making things more ambiguous, mysterious, and complicated with their corporate claptrap.\nThese lectures are short, fun, informative and useful for developing the critical thinking necessary when assesing the quality of the evidence or reasoning which led to a particular conclusion. I will try to incorporate here and there some examples from their course, where it fits naturally with our use-cases and theoretical topics, especially in causality.\nThere are tempting arguments which boil down to this: due to ever increasing volumes and richness of data, together with computing power and innovations in AI – it will lead to the end of theory. I couldn’t disagree more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall Data problems in Big Data\n\n\n\nIn huge datasets of clients and web events, there are lots of observations and many features/attributes being collected, which theoretically should be excellent for a powerful ML model.\nHowever, at the level of each observation, when we go to a very granular aggregation level, the information can be extremely sparse, with high cardinality, inconsistent (all data quality issues). For example, in an e-commerce, for a customer, you might have no information about their purchases, and just a few basic facts about their website navigation.\nSo, you have the cold start problem, data missing not at random, censoring/survival challenges, selection biases. The data at the lowest level becomes discrete, noisy, heteroskedastic. You know the saying: garbage in garbage out.\nEven in ML when there is a big, clean and rich dataset, we can’t escape theory (which is our understanding of the world), in one way or anover. For example, in demand forecasting, we need to provide the model relevant data, factors which are related, plausibly influencing that demand: like weather, holidays, promotions, competition, and so on.\nWe can’t just pour all this data into a ML model and expect the best. It isn’t clear that feeding irrelevant data doesn’t break or bias our model, such that it picks up on noise and spurious correlation, especially in very powerful DL models. That definitely doesn’t help with better decisions.\n\n\nIn conclusion, there is no magic to AI, no silver bullet: more data and better models are often necessary, but not sufficient to improve outcomes. We have to ask the right questions. We have to set objectives aligned with business strategy. We have to frame and formulate a problem well, understanding it in its context. We have to collect relevant data, clean it, understand the processes of missingness. If we let AI decide who enters into a quarantine during the pandemic, what it would optimize for? It’s just a machinery combining statistics and optimization.\nTherefore, critical thinking becomes that much more important when we have these powerful quantitative tools at out fingerprints. A part of a data scientist’s job is to constrain artificial stupidity (more exactly, foolishness, because it does perfectly fine what you instructed it to do) and making sure we’re solving the right problem (sounds trivial, but ofter we solve the wrong problem, without being aware of it)."

    "text": "Sources of Uncertainty\nWe already raised the issue of where does uncertainty come from, mentioning that this question deserves further investigation. In order to do that, we will take an AI, Decision-Making, or Reinforcement Learning perspective, rather than a statistical or econometric one, which will be also very clear later.\nThink of agents who act and interact with their environment and have particular objectives or payoffs. Hopefully, they act in an intelligent way to achieve their goals in time. Given a past sequence of observations \\((x_1, x_2, ..., x_t)\\) and knowledge about the environment, the agent has to choose an action that best achieves its objectives in the presence of various sources of uncertainty. 3333 This paragraph is taken from the brilliant, open book Algorithms for Decision Making, MIT Press - 2022 by M. Kochenderfer, T. Wheeler, and K. Wray\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    Env(Environment) -- observation --> A(Agent)\n    A -- action --> Env\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: This diagram captures the story from the previous chapter in a way which allows itself to a more formal treatment, a kind of joint learning, representation, and dynamic optimization.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcome uncertainty, as the consequences and effects of actions are uncertain. Can we be sure that an intervention works out? We can’t take everything into account when making a decision – it becomes combinatorialy explosive.\nModel uncertainty, that is we can’t be sure that our understanding, model as a simplification of reality is the right one. In decision-making, we often mis-frame problems and in statistics, well, choose the wrong model.\nState uncertainty was discussed at length before, where the true state of the environment is uncertain and moreover, everything changes and is in flux.\nInteraction uncertainty, due to the behavior of the other agents interacting in the environment. For example, competitive firms, social network effects.\n\nWe will focus very little on this last aspect of uncertainty, but you have some tools to reason about it: game-theoretic arguments, ideas from multi-agent systems and agent-based modeling in cybernetics, and finally, graph theory. I think it is an important dimension of reality, however, taking it into account in this course would make it incomparably more complicated and advanced.\nTODO: Provide examples"

If you haven’t seen this problem before, you will probably find the results surprising.6 First, an analytical solution on paper, then simulate it in R or Python to check your answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Birthday Problem\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability at least two people have the same birthday, in a room of \\(n=25\\) people? Assuming independence, for example no twins, every day is equally likely and ignoring the problem of 29th February. Can you generalize it to an arbitrary \\(n\\)?\nFor most practical problems, simulation is an extremely important skill. We might start with it to quickly get an answer, however, for simpler problems, the process of working out the solution analytically sheds light on its structure and easily generalizes to other applications. This simulation indeed, converges to the true results, but it takes a lot of computation, so it might not work when the code needs to run really fast!\n\nnr_people <- 25 \nsimulate_birthdays <- function(nr_people, nr_sim = 10000) {\n    birthday_events <- replicate(n = nr_sim, {\n        birthdays <- sample(x = 1:365, size = nr_people, replace = TRUE)\n        anyDuplicated(birthdays) > 0\n    })\n    mean(birthday_events)  # this returns implicitly!\n}\npr_same_bday <- simulate_birthdays(nr_people)\nbday_match_size <- sapply(2:90, simulate_birthdays, nr_sim = 10000)\n\n\n\nSo, the probability that a room of 25 people has two people with the same birth date is \\(\\approx\\) 0.5741.

The number of pairings grows with respect to the square of the number of participants, such that a group of 23 people contains 253 (23 x 22 / 2) unique pairs of people.\nIn each of these pairings, there is a 364/365 chance of having different birthdays, but this needs to happen for every pair for there to be no matching birthdays across the entire group. Therefore the probability of two people having the same birthday in a group of 23 is:\nGo to richard McElreath’s garden of forking paths next"

    "section": "The probability triple",
    "text": "The probability triple\nIn the previous lecture, I mentioned why did we study probability theory. However, there is one more useful metaphor: remember how important is logic in mathematics, computer science, and philosophy; it’s one of the prerequisites in each of those, an essential tool for reasoning. Then, probability theory is the logic of uncertainty, a formal language. 77 If you studied fuzzy set theory, you might have a case for it being the candidate, however, it fell out of favor in practice – so I would suggest to focus on probability and Bayesian reasoning.\nOften, probability and mathematical statistics are bundled together, as they make perfect sense in sequence, but they have different objectives in mind. Probability theory is concerned with the construction of probability triple \\((\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})\\).\nThat is the foundation for developing useful tools like random variables and probability/cumulative density functions. Then, extending those to joint, conditional probabilities and multidimensional cases, introducing the machinery to operate all of that: like expectation, variance, moment-generating functions, conditioning, marginalization, Bayes theorem. This leads to the laws of large numbers, properties of distributions and their transformations.\nWe use all of those results to model relationships between observed and latent variables in business processes and phenomena. It’s a building block for answering the “simple” question: does X cause Y?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I haven’t used Poisson outside that probability class”\n\n\n\nIf you empathise with this statement, you’re probably aware that it’s important, but wonder if it didn’t come up in practice – what about the rest of the machinery I described? My answer is that it’s so, so ubiquitous, but we need to learn to “see” the opportunities to use this set of tools in decision-making.\nPoisson distribution and process can be a good choice to model counts of events per unit of time, space, with a large number of “trials”, each with a small probability of success.\n\\[\nP(X=k) = \\frac{e^{−\\lambda} \\lambda^k}{k!}; \\space k=0, 1, ...\n\\]\n\nArrivals per hour: requests in a call center, arrivals at a restaurant, website visits. We can use it for capacity planning.\nBankrupcies filed per month, mechanical piece failures per week, engine shutdowns, work-related accidents. We can use these insights to assess risk and improve safety.\nForecasting slow-moving items in a retail store, e.g. for clothing. We’ll investigate the newsvendor problem in excruciating detail, where we have to purchase the inventories ahead of time.\nA famous example is of L. Bortkiewicz: in Prussian army there were 0.70 deaths per one corps per one year caused by horse kicks. (“Law of small numbers”).\n\nJust before you get all excited about these applications, keep in mind that every distribution has a story behind it, and a set of assumptions that have to be met.\n\n\nOther tools are as prevalent and useful: Bayes rule, DAGs (directed acyclic graphs of random variables), the exponential family, laws of large numbers and the cental limit theorem. It holds both in applications and statistics itself.\nIn probability theory, we’re still in a mathematical world trying to capture the essence of the real world, but ultimately, we need statistical inference to estimate those parameters from data. Before we get into it in more detail: mathematically, computationally and in terms of business cases, we have to define that foundation – the probability triple.\nTo make the following more clear, let’s start with an experiment where we show a customer ten clothing items (a collection), and they have to pick the one they like best. If we repeated it with many customers, preferably representative for the population of interest,8 a pattern would emerge. This is an example of a discrete Outcome Set (or universal set, of all possible results). Alternatively, think of pebbles in an urn, where each one represents an outcome.8 You might intuitively know what a population is, but there are surprisingly many pitfalls, so we’ll investigate that notion with lots of care.\nAs an academic aside, we have to thank Kolmogorov for putting probability into a rigorous, axiomatic framework based on set theory and making it open for mathematical enquiry with tools from mathematical analysis, which by that time were well-established. That is important, because we can’t work the same naive way with continuous measurements and phenomena, as we do with pebbles.\n\nA random experiment (\\(\\mathscr{E}\\)) is a set of conditions which are favorable for an event in a given form. It is that real-world process of interest which we try to simplify, with the following properties:\n\nPossible results and outcomes are known apriori and exhaustably. For example: a coin/dice toss, quantity sold, time in a subscription, a default on the credit, a choice between subscriptions.\nIt’s never known which of the results of \\(\\mathscr{E}\\) will manifest or appear before we run the experiment, the “experiment” amounting to randomly picking that clothing item or a pebble from the urn.\nDespite that, there is a perceptible regularity, which can be eventually measured and quantified, that is, encoding the idea of a probabilistic “law” in the results. That regularity could be a result of the large scale of the phenomena, for example, many customers seeing a product on the shelf.\nRepeatability of the conditions in which the experiment runs, like the comparability and perservation of context. This is optional in the Bayesian perspective, where we’re not thinking in long-run frequency terms. 9\n\nElementary event as an auxiliaty construction: one of the possible results of \\(\\mathscr{E}\\), usually denoted by \\(\\omega_i \\in \\Omega\\).\nUniversal set \\(\\Omega = \\{ \\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\dots \\}\\) is also called (Outcome/ State/ Selection space). It suggests the idea of complementarity and stochasticity: we don’t know which \\(\\omega_i\\) will manifest, thus is a key object for a further formalization of probability measures.\nWe care not only about an event \\(A = \\bigcup\\limits_{i = 1}^n \\omega_i\\) (which is an union of elementary events) and its realization, but also about other events in the Universal Set, because they might contribute with additional information (about the probability) of our event of interest – remember conditioning? This means that we we’re interested in “all” other events.\nThe event space \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is a sigma-algebra, should be defined on sets of subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) and this is where measure theory shines. For technical reasons, we usually can’t define a probability measure on all sets of subsets. On an intuitive note, we define the probability measure on sigma-algebras because if those conditions did not hold, the measure wouldn’t make sense, unions of events would step out of the bounds of event space.\nProbability as an extension of the measure: chance of events realizing. Note that the perceptible regularity can be thought as the ability to assign a probability (number between 0 and 1) to elementary events: \\(\\mathbb{P}(\\omega_i)\\). This is why additivity properties are key, as we care about random events, not only elementary events.\n\n9 \n\n\nSource: Ross This is the view of probability as a long-run frequency of events occuring, for example, flipping a coin\n\n\n\nDef: Algebra and Sigma-Algebra\nA set of subsets \\(\\mathcal{F} \\subset 2^\\Omega\\) is an algebra (field) if the following holds:\n\n\\(\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) and \\(\\varnothing \\in \\mathcal{F}\\)\nIf \\(A \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) then \\(A^C \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) (closed under complements)\nIf \\(A, B \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) then \\(A \\cup B \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) (closed under union). Note that 2 and 3 imply that it’s closed under countable intersection\nThe additional condition for sigma-algebra: sigma refers to countability. If \\(\\{ A_i \\}_{i \\ge 1} \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) then \\(\\bigcup\\limits_{i \\ge 1} A_i \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) (closed under countable union)\n\n\n\n\nSource: Wikimedia A beautiful visual representation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbability Measure\n\n\n\nSuppose we have defined a measurable space \\((\\Omega, \\mathcal{F})\\), where \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is a sigma-algebra. A probability measure is the function \\(\\mathbb{P}:\\mathcal{F} \\rightarrow [0, 1]\\) such that:\n\n\\(\\mathbb{P}(\\Omega) = 1\\) \nFor countable sequences of mutually disjoint effects, i.e. \\(\\forall \\{ A_i \\}_{i \\ge 1}\\) where \\(A_i \\bigcap\\limits_{i \\ne j} A_j = \\varnothing\\), the following holds \\(\\mathbb{P}(\\bigcup\\limits_{i \\ge 1} A_i) = \\sum\\limits_{i \\ge 1} \\mathbb{P}(A_i)\\)\n\n\n\nA probability triple \\((\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})\\) is the fundamental object the whole probability theory is constructed upon. Again, Kolmogorov took the informal, gambling-type probability and put it onto axiomatic foundations – which enabled future breakthroughs. Notice that this definition of probability is not the naive one, of number of successes over the total possible numbers an event could arise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasure theory rabbit hole: Why not all subsets?\n\n\n\nThe reasons for this are very technical, and the concept of a sigma-algebra is essential in resolving the resulting paradoxes. If you’re interested in these technical details, you can check out my relatively accessible introudction to measure theory and the Caratheodori extension theorem.\n\nEven though you can go a long way as a practitioner with standard tools in probability theory, deeply understanding its measure-theoretic foundations could open up a whole new world to the researcher. It’s easy to take the results from statistics and probability for granted, but it’s useful to be aware what hides beneath the surface.\nEvans Lawrence gives the following example of a function which is neither discrete nor continuous, for which you flip a coin and if it comes heads, draw from an uniform distribution and in case of tails a unit mass at one. If \\(\\chi_{[0,1]}(x) = (e^{ix} - 1)/ix\\) is the characteristic function of the interval from zero to one, in a way you can formulate its density, but usually it’s not the case, nor is it very helpful to think about it in such terms.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n    p(x) = w_1 \\chi_{[0,1]}(x) +  w_2\\delta_1(x)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nEven though you can visualize this in two dimensions as the uniform and a spike, or as a CDF with a discontinuity, this approach just breaks down in higher dimensions or more complicated combinations of functions.\n\n\n\nJeffrey Rosenthal begins his book by a similar motivation, constructing the following random variable as a coin toss between a discrete \\(X \\sim Pois(\\lambda)\\) and continuous \\(Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\) r.v.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n    Z = \\begin{cases}\n    X, p = 0.5 \\\\\n    Y, p = 0.5\n    \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nHe then challenges the readers to come up with the expected value \\(\\mathbb{E}[Z^2]\\) and asks on what is it defined? It is indeed a hard question.\nWe stumble upon different interpretations of probability (frequentists vs bayesians), when trying to clarify that “perceptible regularity”, despite the mathematics of probability theory being exactly the same. These are not “theorems” to prove, but rather axioms and philosophies often taken in practice as the starting point.\nThe frequency theory defines the probability of an outcome as the limiting frequency with which that outcome appears in a long series of similar events. If our experiment or investigation is such that those relative frequencies converge, then we can prove the LLN and the CLT. Basically, that we should view probability and predictions based on historical data. 1010 “To a frequentist, the probability of an event is intrinsic to that event’s nature and not something perceived, only discovered.”\nFormally, we can represent this statement by Bernoulli’s theorem, which is a special case of Law of Large Numbers, where \\(m_n\\) is the number of times an event \\(A\\) occurs in \\(n\\) trials.\n\\[\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{m_n}{n} = p\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequency Convergence as Statistical Stability\n\n\n\nSince we don’t have an infinite number of trials, the best we can do is to say that “experimental evidence strongly suggests statistical stability”. This applies really well in gambling (by design) and physics, but is it plausible in human behavior? I don’t think so, but it might be unreasonably effective, even if not true.\n\n\n\n\nSo, which one do you recommend? It depends, learn both! But I would agree with Richard McElreath’s meme: it’s the scientific process that has the last laugh\n\nBayesians view probability as the degree of confidence in a belief, an apriori guess or knowledge, that is, before seeing the data. Then, using inverse probability, you update your beliefs in the face of evidence and data. Often, you do have knowledge and can define your prior probabilities by a process of ellicitation – it should’t be too vague, neither dogmatic. Other Bayesians put in great effort to pick non-informative priors, as the data should quickly overwhelm it.\nTODO: Ellicitation of probability -> we’ll do more later with inference\n\nRandom Variables\nThank you for bearing with me through the theory you have probably seen before, but we’re not done. We’re still in the land of set theory, and it is very hard to operate that way in practice – so, we need a new concept which will allow us to use the tools of mathematical analysis in probability, in order to make it feasible for practical uses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe breakthrough idea of a Random Variable\n\n\n\nWe started from some phenomena of interest and a random experiment. The random variable is a necessary abstraction in order to mathematically define quantifiable characteristics of the objects. Meaning, we start working with numbers instead of some qualitative properties. Now, we’re in business!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom Variable is not a variable, nor random\n\n\n\nA random variable is quantificator of elementary events, a function defined on the outcome space which maps the elementary events to the real number line. That mapping can’t be done in any way we wish, it has to perserve the informational structure of the sample space. That is one of the technical reasons for sigma-algebras we mentioned before and is related to the idea of measurability, meaning we can assign a meaningful “volume”.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nX(\\omega):\\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\\\\ns.t. ~~ \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega | X(\\omega) \\leq r, \\forall r \\in \\mathbb{R} \\} \\in \\mathcal{F}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nLet’s figure out what the hell do we mean by that fine print condition, using the diagram below. The idea of conservation of the informational structure is actually equivalent to the one of measurablility. If this property doesn’t hold, it’s not possible to explicitly and uniquely refer to the sets (events) of interest.\nThe idea is that the preimage defined above \\(X^{-1}((-\\infty,r]) = E \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) on the following interval corresponds to an event E which should be in the event space \\(\\mathcal{F}\\). Because the only thing that varies is the limit of the interval r, the randomness comes from it. Also, it automatically suggests the idea of the Cumulative Distribution Function, which is \\(F_X(X \\le r)\\).\n\n\nCDF, one of the most important constructs in probability is a direct consequence of the definition of the random variable:\n\\[\nP(A ≤ r) = F_X(X ≤ r)\n\\]\nIn the practice of modeling, we often work with probability density functions, because it is more convenient in many cases. Then, in order to translate to probabilities, we would think in terms of areas under that curve. For sure, you remember the following duality between CFD and PDF:\n\\[\nF'(x) = p(x)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nIdea: Norman Wildberger, Gheorghe Ruxanda. A graphical representation of the random variable. It is the construct that enables us to define the statistical population (some relevant aspect of it to us)!\n\n\n\nAs a motivation of why do we have to understand all of this, when for most practical applications we can get by just fine with using the results and tools from probability, I will introduce two examples: one of compositional data analysis11 and time series analysis. What I want to say, is that for more “exotic” applications, we might need to tweak that probability triple because of the nature of the problem, which has downstream consequences for all the statistical machinery we use in those applications.11 \n\n\n\n\nSource: Dumuid: Data in a Simplex, which is later translated to \\(R^n\\) by a carefully constructed basis expansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe curious case of Compositional Data Analysis\n\n\n\nSometimes, the data doesn’t “live” in our normal, intuitive, euclidian space \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). There are cases when the object of our analysis are proportions or compositions: think of what a material is made of, the proportion of the demand for different sizes of a shoe or garment.\nWe don’t necessarily care about their absolute value, but about their relative proportion. If we blindly apply traditional methods, or even statistical summaries, we will quickly hit weird results and paradoxes. So, we have to tweak existing methods we have make sense for compositions.\nCompositional data analysis solves those issues by defining a probability triple over the simplex (instead of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\)): \\((\\mathcal{S}^n, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})\\). This leads to a different definition of the event space \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), which is also a sigma-algebra and a different definition of the probability measure \\(\\mathbb{P}\\).\n\n\nRemember our exaple of pigeon superstition in the context of learning? It is not surprising to me that measure theory becomes important in Learning Theory,12 which is exactly those carefully formulated principles that will prevent our automated learners to become supersitious.12 Even though most courses from which I studied don’t mention it explicitly (Yaser Abu-Mostafa, Shai Ben-David, Reza Shadmehr), according to Mikio’s Brown answer it’s essential in the idea of uniform convergence and its bounds, where “you consider the probability of a supremum over an infinite set of functions, but out of the box measure theory only allows for constructions with countably infinite index sets”.\nFor the next example, you don’t have to understand what Gaussian Processes are or are used for. However, later in the course, we will discuss nonparametric methods for hypothesis testing. Their usefulness comes from the fact that we make less distributional assumptions about our population, therefore getting more robust results, in contrast with choosing a wrong model or distribution.\nIt’s not that these methods don’t have parameters, but the parametrization varies depending on how much data we have, which makes them very flexible in a wide variety of applications, where we just don’t know what is a reasonable distribution or parametric functional form for the relationship that we model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonparametrics and Gaussian Processes\n\n\n\n\nIf we’re thinking about a regression from the nonparametric perspective: that is, over a set of abstract functions: \\(f(x) \\in \\mathscr{C}^2:X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\), 13 we might want to know how a draw of samples from an infinite set of continuous differentiable functions might look like.13 \n\n\n\n\nSource: Bizovi: A posterior distribution of the Gaussian Processes, when conditioned on data\n\n\n\n\\[\nf(x) \\sim GP(\\mu(x); K(x,x'))\n\\]\nThe questions arises: how to define a PDF (probability density function) in this space? In my bachelor thesis, I got away with using Gaussian Processes, which are a very special class of stochastic processes. In this special case I could informally define an apriori distribution by defining the mean vector and Kernel (covariance function), then condition it on observed data with a Normal Likelihood.\n\\[\np(f(x) \\, |\\left \\{ x\\right \\})=\\frac{p(\\left \\{ x\\right \\}| \\, f) \\, \\mathbf{p(f)}}{p(\\left \\{ x\\right \\})}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of stochastic processes, we work with a sequence of random variables \\(\\{X_t, t \\in T \\}\\) and start asking questions:\n\nWhat kind of time dependency is there? (autocorrelation)\nWhat is the long-run behavior?\nCan we say something about extreme events?\n\nA lot of important applications in economics and finance are dynamic, so we have to work with time series very often. It gets worse when data is correlated not only in time, but also geographically – which is why the field of spatio-temporal data analysis is in such demand right now for policy-making.\nThus, a natural extension of this probability machinery we discussed so far is stochastic processes, underlying these dynamical systems. We can look at our time series as a manifestation, a particular instantiation of this latent process. Depending on which one we choose, we can model a wide range of phenomena.\n\n\nJoint, Conditional, and Marginal Distributions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayes Rule"

    "text": "Exam Study Guide\n\nData Science in Business Context\nThe first 4 topics are covered in detail here and the course homepage gives additional context. The latter 3 were discussed extensively in the courses, but I will provide alternative resources for study, in case you missed those lectures.\n\nData Science examples of Business Applications - be able to explain most common use-cases in multiple industries, like e-commerce, finance and banking, medicine.\nVUCA, SWOT and Business Strategy - articulate some properties of the business environment, understand firm’s trajectory and how it could translate into a business strategy. Make sure you understand what a strategy is and how it influences our modeling process.\nWhat is AI, Data Science, Cybernetics - understand that, in a nutshell, it’s about decision-making under uncertainty at scale, in a given domain of expertise.\nAnalytics vs Stats vs ML - be able to match a particular problem with one (or a combination) of these approaches to data-driven problem solving. Know when NOT to use one.\nWhat is Machine Learning? Understand the idea of inductive reasoning, generalization, and be able to ‘draw’/outline the core mechanism of the machine learning. Give examples when it can go wrong or awry. If you have time, refer to this course, lecture 1 and 2.\nNewsvendor problem - understand this demand planning model in business terms and translate it into a mathematical model. Refer to this tutorial if you missed the lectures.\n\nReason about the role and sources of uncertainty in the decisions and how can we do a stochastic optimization.\nArticulate and formalize the trade-offs we’re facing.\nWhat happens if the goods are not perishable, what kind of costs we will suffer then?\nWhat are some different modeling options for the demand. What kind of distributions will be appropriate for slow-moving, fast-moving, intermittent demand.\n\nPrice optimization (fixed capacity) - Give some examples of when it happens in practice. Same questions and concerns as in the newsvendor problem apply. Refer to this tutorial by Dr. Adam Fleischhacker if you missed the discussions during the lectures.\n\n\n\nThe processes of data science\nAll too often we jump into data analysis and modeling without formulating well the objectives and the problem. Focusing on how to implement and use a model without following a rigorous process can be error-prone and counterproductive. You have to understand these 3 processes and think how would you structure your project in practice for a particular application.\n\n12 Steps of ML by Cassie Kozyrkov, CRISP-DM (any resource on the latter will do). Please, read this as it is mandatory.\n12 Steps of Statistics by Cassie Kozyrkov, along with her Google lecture on statistical thinking.\nBusiness Analyst’s Workflow by Dr. Adam Fleischhacker\n\n\n\nStatistical fundamentals\nThis is the most difficult part of the course, going into the depths of statistical foundations. Even though you encountered most of these topics in the introductory statistics courses, it is very easy to misunderstand and apply these methods mechanically. Therefore, fundamental – doesn’t mean easy, nor basic nor trivial. The exam will not ask you to compute or solve puzzles, but to appropriately define, justify and apply these (choices) in the context of business applications.\n\nHow does linear algebra, probability, statistics, mathematical analysis, operations research, and economics contribute to Data Science and decision-making? Explained here\nProbability triple and Random Variables - a semi-formal exposition is written in this chapter of course website.\nCollectivity, Statistical Population, Sample - where defining the population is the contract for our experiment, and the sampling process is critical. Explained well and in great detail here and here.\nParameter, Estimator, Estimation/Statistic - same resources as above\nStories behnid distributions: \\(\\chi^2_k, t_k, Pois(\\lambda), N(\\mu, \\sigma^2), Exp(\\lambda)\\) - examples with simulation and stories / applications with more math. Look at this interactive visualization which compares t and N.\nDifference between probability theory and mathematical statistics - a beautiful explanation\nCentral Limit Theorem (Kolmogorov), deMoivre - the most dangerous equation. Asymptotics. the theorem and simulations here\nEstimator properties: Bias, Consistency, Efficiency - you can find an accessible explanation with R code in openforecast\nBias-Variance tradeoff - For an intuitive explanation, watch lecture 8, slides. See how this tradeoff needs an update for the modern machine learning.\nBootstrap - chapter 10 or page 249\nNonparametric methods - what is the benefit, name a few equivalents. Be able to explain a signed-rank transformation. This is the simplest and the most accessible explanation I know of so far.\nBayesian vs Frequentist inference - chapter 2, 3, 4. Here is a nice interactive visualization for Bayesian updating.\nLikelihood - either from previous books or this interactive visualization\n\n\n\nExperiment Design and A/B Testing\nOnce you have a good grip on those statistical fundamentals, which are like cogs in the machinery of statistics, you can apply them to hypothesis testing and experiment design. I’m emphasizing again the understanding and letting go of mechanical application of procedures and conventions (p-values, \\(\\alpha, \\beta\\), statistical tests). You have to be able to justify all the choices you make during the phase of experiment design, that is before running the experiment.\n\nUnderstanding the philosophy of falsification and how it applies to hypothesis testing. Week2 of this course has a great 20 minute explanation.\nRemember the importance of those 12 steps of statistics, especially the Default Action. For a more classical exposition - check this out.\nConfidence Intervals - first check out this simulation. Also chapter 12, uses bootstrap to estimate those.\np-values - simulation, simulation of distirbutions under H0/Ha\nType 1, 2 errors, Type 3 errors (solving the wrong problem) - chapter14\nA/B Testing scheme - An end-to-end example, but be careful to follow the 12 steps we have and not to forget to define the Default Action.\nExperiment Design and Hypothesis testing pitfalls - from HBR, 8 pitfalls, A/A tests, user interference\nMetric Design andproperties of good metrics - an example\nRelevance and Significance - Read this paper by Werner Stahel (optional)\nNon-Inferiority testing - This visualization\nEffect size, Power, Sample Size - here, and here and here.
