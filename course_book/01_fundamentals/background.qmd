# Data Science in Business Context

You might've heard that data scientist is the sexiest job of 21st century, that AI is going to take over, Deep Reinforcement Learning models are beating people at Dota and Chess, solving almost-impossible protein-folding problems. But what does it actually mean, if we step outside the hype/buzzwords, use a plain language, and apply these ideas in a more down-to-earth, day-to-day problems and challenges in businesses?

How does this landscape of Data Science look like? What are the roles and jobs? What is the process for building smarter, data-driven software systems; drawing more reliable inferences and conclusions from data and theory? How does a day in data scientist's life look like?

> First and foremost, AI is about **Decision-Making, at Scale, under Uncertainty** [^cassie-ai-def]. You can make sense of the terminology and general confusion of terms, by reading M. I. Jordan's brilliant article [^jordan-ai], which tell the history of "AI" and how this confusion arose. He also points out how many of the claims in the field, as of today are a stretch (i.e. the revolution hasn't happened yet) [^jordan-revolution].

We have to recognize that data science is an umbrella term, with interdisciplinarity at its core. It draws inspiration, puts together multiple fields and continuously evolves. Despite that, we can clearly define **what** it does (see above), and **how** (depending on the perspective taken). For practical, pragmatic intents and purposes, we can distinguish 3 ways of thinking, which have to work harmoniously together, in order for a data science project to be successful:

* Analytics and Data Mining - with the main goal of formulating better research questions (i.e. **inspiration**), find interesting and relevant stuff in massive datasets
* Machine Learning - learning from data, finding invariants/patterns, which generalize beyond the sample and training data, i.e. going from experience to expertise in an automated way
* Statistics, and especially causal inference - for making decisions with high stakes, and having greater confidence, rigor in the inferences and conclusions drawn

One has to cycle through these approaches, gain greater understanding, experience and skill in them, in order to use the appropriate tools in the right context. I recommend the following 4-part presentation [^cassie-mfml] by Cassie Kozyrkov, so that you get a good idea of how "AI" fits into organization and decision-making process. I recommend following her and, basically reading everything she has written on medium [^cassie-ref].

Pay close attention to the process of developing data-driven products [^cassie-steps] and what are the prerequisites for an AI project to be successful (or doomed from the very start). It is important not to skip the relevant steps, understand the roles of people involved: from decision-makers, to statisticians and data engineers. A good blueprint [^pair] for thinking about how to define and plan an AI project is given by Google's PAIR (People and AI research group).

Make no mistake, the data science field is fascinating and the applications exciting, but as you well know from statistics, there are numerous pitfalls we can fall into. I think it is useful to demistify AI, data science, and get humble, down to earth about what it can and can't do -- the power, but also the limitations:
- Just take a look at how many "AI" tools have been built to catch covid, and none helped [^mit-ai-covid]
- One part of the problem is the mismatch between the real/business problem and objectives, and what models optimize for. Vincent Warmerdam brilliantly explains it in "The profession of solving the wrong problem"[^war-wrong-problem] and "How to constrain artificial stupidity" [^war-stupidity].

As a last, shameless plug, I'll reference you to my conference talk [^pragmatic-ai-gcp], which shows how can AI add value to organizations, by taking a pragmatic approach to it. I introduce the idea of "Full Stack Data Apps", which is critical in making the vision of decision-making under uncertainty at scale, a reality, or at least, give it a greater probability of succeeding (the definition of success being that it is used and useful).
