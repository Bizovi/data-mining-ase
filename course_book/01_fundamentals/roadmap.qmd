## Module I: Business Decisions and Probability

The first module is putting the rest of the course on a solid foundation, emphasizing again and again the key idea of Decision-Making Under Uncertainty at Scale. Understand the problem, the methodology, and the tools at your disposal.

The most difficult part of the module is the statistical fundamentals, as it is very easy to misunderstand and apply these methods mechanically. Therefore, fundamental -- doesn't mean easy, nor basic, nor trivial. Most courses make you solve puzzles, but I ask you to appropriately define, justify, and apply the choice of method and tool in the context of business applications.

## Do you have a process for Statistics and ML?

All too often we jump into data analysis and modeling without formulating well the objectives and the problem. Focusing on how to implement and use a model  without following a rigorous process can be error-prone and counterproductive. You have to understand these 3 processes and think how would you structure your project in practice for a particular application.

There are many ways to organize this module in lectures. You can find a possible schedule in the table, with associated readings/resources and a mind-map of topics in the diagram below it. Some lectures are conceptual, some *mathematical* and in some we **code and practice**. 

The courses I teach are usually short and intensive, so the following schedule would take two weeks to cover, meaning the next two weeks I can focus on Bayesian statistics, causal inference, or machine learning -- with more emphasis on modeling or engineering, depending on the audience.

Why these exact topics, since other courses in 16 lectures teach you either statistical learning, probability, statistics, causality, deep learning? Of course, and they're excellent at teaching exactly that, so I refer to those amazing resources, books, courses when it comes to the tool/model and didactic examples.

Our goal in the first module is to have a solid general foundation for all of those topics and domains. In order to achieve that, we need to understand the business environment and challenges it faces, mathematically and conceptually get the main ideas from probability and statistics, and be prepared with our computational skills and tooling to tackle those challenges. Here are all of these concepts illustrated in the following mind-map:
