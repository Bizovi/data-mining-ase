## Module I: Business School for Data Scientists

The "business school" emphasizes again and again the idea of **Decision-Making Under Uncertainty at Scale**, across many industries and use-cases. We walk through three perspectives: Analytics, Machine Learning, and Statistics -- then develop methodologies for each one. There are two representative case-studies in which we go in-depth: the Newsvendor Problem and Price Optimization.

By convention, lectures whith mathematical inclination are marked by (*) and **programming** in bold and (**). Often we do both.

## Module II: Probability and Statistics

There are so many pitfalls in statistics and many of them come from a misunderstanding about the nature of statistical inference, a mechanical application of methods, and an insufficient grasp of fundamentals.

::: {.column-margin}

I prefer to fill in the gaps with **stories** and **simulations**, however, in some cases the mathematical formalism and abstractions can't be avoided and actually help understanding

:::

Therefore, fundamental -- doesn't mean easy, nor basic, nor trivial. Most courses make you solve puzzles, but I ask you to appropriately define, justify, and apply the choice of method and tool in the context of business applications.

## Module III: Applied Bayesian Statistics

After the first two modules, we should have a solid foundation for building more realistic models. As discussed in the introduction, randomized experiments and A/B tests have obvious limitations: might be unfeasible, unethical, or just not the right tool.

::: {.column-margin}

We are not wasting time by switching to Bayes (7 lectures to get to GLMs), because we treat all models under the same framework.

:::

Instead of taking regression as the starting point, then going into advanced econometrics -- I prefer we switch to a Bayesian perspective, so we can build custom models taking into account the particularities of the phenomena of interest. The course culminates in Hierarchical GLMs, which should be sufficient for the majority of problems you encounter in practice, or at least a good starting point.

Why these exact topics, since other courses in 18 lectures teach you either statistical learning, probability, statistics, causality, or deep learning? Of course, and they're excellent at teaching exactly that, so I refer to those amazing resources, books, courses when it comes to the tool/model and didactic examples.

Our goal in the first module is to have a solid general foundation for all of those topics and domains. In order to achieve that, we need to understand the business environment and challenges it faces, mathematically and conceptually get the main ideas from probability and statistics, and be prepared with our computational skills and tooling to tackle those challenges.
