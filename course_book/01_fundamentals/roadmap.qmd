## Module I: Business School for Data Scientists

The "business school" emphasizes again and again the idea of **Decision-Making Under Uncertainty at Scale**, across many industries and use-cases. First, we learn new ways to understand the domain and formulate the problem / question well with respect to strategy / objectives.

Then, we review different methodologies for analytics, statistics, and machine learning. By following a structured approach to problem-solving, we increase the chances of implementing a successful solution. 

This is necessary, but by no means sufficient -- we will be spending the rest of the course figuring out the nitty-gritty details of the tools (models, methods, algorithms) and acquiring the skills to actually solve those real-world challenges.

## Do you have a process for Statistics and ML?

All too often we jump into data analysis and modeling without formulating well the objectives and the problem. Focusing on how to implement and use a model  without following a rigorous process can be error-prone and counterproductive.

## Module II: Probability and Statistics

There are so many pitfalls in statistics and many of them come from a misunderstanding about the nature of statistical inference, a mechanical application of methods, and an insufficient grasp of fundamentals.

Therefore, fundamental -- doesn't mean easy, nor basic, nor trivial. Most courses make you solve puzzles, but I ask you to appropriately define, justify, and apply the choice of method and tool in the context of business applications.

We start from the foundations of probability, however, I do not cover calculus, linear algebra, or other mathematical tools for data analysis. We do much more programming than mathematics, therefore, the ability to code in a programming language like Python or R is a must.

Why these exact topics, since other courses in 18 lectures teach you either statistical learning, probability, statistics, causality, or deep learning? Of course, and they're excellent at teaching exactly that, so I refer to those amazing resources, books, courses when it comes to the tool/model and didactic examples.

Our goal in the first module is to have a solid general foundation for all of those topics and domains. In order to achieve that, we need to understand the business environment and challenges it faces, mathematically and conceptually get the main ideas from probability and statistics, and be prepared with our computational skills and tooling to tackle those challenges.
