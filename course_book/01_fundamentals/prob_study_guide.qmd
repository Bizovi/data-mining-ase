## Module II: Probability and Statistics

There are so many pitfalls in statistics and many of them come from a misunderstanding about the nature of statistical inference, a mechanical application of methods, and an insufficient grasp of fundamentals.

I prefer to fill in the gaps with **stories** and **simulations**, however, in some cases the mathematical formalism and abstractions can't be avoided and actually help understanding

Therefore, fundamental -- doesn't mean easy, nor basic, nor trivial. Most courses make you solve puzzles, but I ask you to appropriately define, justify, and apply the choice of method and tool in the context of business applications.
