## What is the purpose of a business?


::: {.callout-note}
## Understanding and operating modern businesses is complicated 

Most startups fail. ^[How many do you think survive in the first 5 years in the US?] One has to make many **good decisions** over a long period of time to have a chance at success in a competitive environment.
:::

- Maximize profits? Compete, grow, and gain market share?
- Maximize shareholder value? ^[@dumbestidea] ^[@evonomics]
- Bring added value to customers by solving a problem?
- Contribute to economy and society (tax, employment)?
- Create new markets to allocate resources efficiently?

::: {.aside}
Discussion: score from 1 to 5 on how important each reason is for you ^[Then ask yourself, are you open to founding a startup in the next 5 years?]
:::


## Model = simplified representation

Why do we build models? Mental, mathematical, statistical? ^[For example, the coin flip is a wonderful abstraction, especially when the flips or events are independent]

- We need to [understand]{.underline} ^[In a causal sense, that is if we intervene, this is what is going to happen. Or in the predictive sense] a system to make decisions
- Reality is overwhelming and [combinatorially explosive]{.underline} ^[Imagine how many possible paths are there if for every minute we have a choice between 20 actions: read, eat, move, watch, etc]
- We want to capture the essential aspects of phenomena
- While minimizing our biases and foolishness ^[This is not to minimize what intuition resulting from deep knowledge and experience can bring to the table]

All models have assumptions, pressupositions, and limitations:

- Models are golemns of Prague -- Richard McElreath
- All models are wrong, but some are useful -- George Box

## What will we study?

::: {.callout-tip}
## Fundamentals of business economics and statistical modeling:

$$ Question \longrightarrow Modeling \longrightarrow Insight \longrightarrow Action \longrightarrow Outcome $$

:::

- Understand problem space to ask the right questions ^[This is what you basically study in Business Analytics classes: ways to think about diagnosis, strategy, business processes, stakeholders, etc]
- So that we can build custom statistical models 
- Which bring insight into consequences of actions
- So that we're informed which actions that should be taken
- Such that a firm can achieve its ST/LT objectives


::: {.aside}
Notice the language of problem space and solution space, as you will encounter it
:::

## Data science is an umbrella term

We have to understand clearly what we mean by AI, ML, and Analytics. Then, pick the right tool for each problem


- **AI** | Decision making under uncertainty at scale
- **Cybernetics** | The science of general regularities of **Information Processing** and **Control** in CAS ^[@jordanAI]
- **ML** | Expertise from Experience in an automated way ^[@cassieMFML]
- **Analytics** | Exploratory analyses to formulate hypotheses 
- **Statistics** | Changing your mind given new evidence

::: {.aside}
Discussion: what is a problem (AI, CogSci) and why framing is key
:::

## What are some typical applications?

- Demand planning, inventory optimization, production ^[Deep dive in Logistics class. My strong recommendation is to apply it in practice and read N. Vandeput]
- Revenue management, pricing, and promotion
- Advertisement and conversion optimization
- Customer behavior and preferences: ^[You will deep dive into customer psychology and decisions under uncertainty in the behavioral economics class]
  - Churn, repurchase, engagement, LTV, WTP 
  - Fraud, credit default, insurance risk ^[These models are the way you operationalize a risk management strategy at scale ("minimize bleeding")]
  - Choice modeling, recommender systems, uplift
- Improving products, assortment, merch, processes

## Weak or specialized AI

::: {style="font-size:80px"}
Decision-Making Under Uncertainty at Scale
:::

- domain-specific (medicine vs finance vs automotive ...)
- data-driven (key idea of learning from data)
- limited degrees of autonomy and notions of agency
- sometimes concerned with networks of agents

::: {.aside}
AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Michael Jordan - Stop calling everything AI
:::


## Unpacking Cybernetics

- **Control** $\implies$ **goal-directedness**. Action to steer to a trajectory or autopoesis (perserve $(S-f)_{org}$)
- **Information Processing** $\implies$ pattern recoginition, perception, modeling & inference
- **General regularities** $\implies$ plausible of control and information processing across fields and CAS
- Animal refers to applications in biology, machine -- in engineering, and human -- in our society and behavior.


::: {.aside}
In economic cybernetics, we're concerned with economics, society and human behavior, rather than engineering, biology, or natural science applications.
:::



## Analytics vs ML vs Stats

![*Source: xkcd;* Instead of Stats, I would say we want Causal Inference](img/ds-adventure.png "Analysis"){width="70%"}


::: {.aside}
Analytics is for inspiration. Formulating a hypothesis is a science and art.
Think of a good analyst as a detective. One can also model, but still do analytics
:::

## Three challenges in statistics

First and foremost, you have to start with a research topic, question and [design your study]{.underline} or experiment. It's hard!

::: {.callout-tip}
## You might've heard of internal and external validity

A. Gelman clarifies very well three different aspects of statistical inference. Always remember this when we discuss stats! We want to generalize in terms of:

$$Sample \longrightarrow Population$$

$$Treatment \longrightarrow Control$$

$$Measurement \longrightarrow Construct$$

The holy grail is to build statistical models based on the [causal processes]{.underline} informed by theories / hypotheses. Then model how we [measured]{.underline},^[We'll dedicate one lecture on it, but you have whole specialized classes on business metrics] and [collected data]{.underline}.^[Again, we treat it in the most general sense, but you have BI classes which show you how data is collected and structured in most businesses]
:::


## Isn't causal inference just stats?

::: {.callout-important}
## The hardest problem, worthy of a Nobel prize in econometrics

How many times have you heard that correlation doesn't imply causation? Yet, ALL the methods you studied so far are not sufficient to fully justify causality, even Granger!
:::

1. Theoretical estimand (quantity or effect of interest)
2. Scientific (causal) models - DAGs of influence
3. Use (1) and (2) to build a Statistical Model
4. Simulate from (2) to prove (3) $\implies$ (1)
5. Analyze and make inferences with real data

::: {.aside}
Causal inference can also be seen as a problem of inferring/predicting missing data
:::



## Why do we need these tools?

> VUCA: Volatile | Uncertain | Complex | Ambiguous

- A problem well formulated is halfway solved
- Limited resources, conflicting objectives
  - therefore, have to make tradeoffs
- Decisions informed by robust predictions and evidence
- Do you have what it takes to navigate this environment?
  - the tools, understanding and skills
  - attitude: learning and growth mindset




## To make better decisions!

> Think of youself as a business person with superpowers

## Conversation: fields & use-cases

- What are the **fields** in which data science methods are extensively used? e.g. finance, genomics, psychology, ...
- What are some **products** that use AI, data science, data-driven systems? What are their **use-cases**? e.g. uber ...

::: {.callout-tip}
## Think in terms of reverse engineering

When using those products, how do you think those systems were designed? 

- What were the goals and user/client needs? What were the firm's objective?
- What constraints did they hit? Why is it a difficult problem?
- What are some potential approaches they settled on? What is a naive solution?

## The easiest and most difficult course

 > “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.” ― A Tale of Two Cities, [@dickens], 


- No memorization, proofs or solving on paper
- You have to really understand, justify choices, write code
- No single, unique solution, but many tradeoffs
