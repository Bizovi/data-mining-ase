## Three critical questions

![Status Quo, Desired and Feared Trajectories in systems' dynamics. *Source:* [Kim Warren](https://strategydynamics.com/free/assets/The%20Dynamics%20of%20Strategy,%202016.pdf)](img/trajectories.png){width="90%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **What** happened (data / facts) and **Why** (inference)?
- **Where** are we likely going if we do things as before?
    - Is it a feared scenario?
    - What contributes to it?
- **How** to achieve the desired trajectory? Is it realistic?
:::

::::

::: {.aside}
The topic of how to measure performance is complicated and deserves a deep-dive.

## Trajectories and SWOT diagnosis

:::: {.callout-note}
## What would an apparel e-commerce want?

($\max$) **Top line** (revenue) | **bottom line** (EBITDA) | customer **satisfaction** | LTV ^[some industries have specific metrics like daily users, revenue per mile per sq.m]

- Status Quo: what is most likely trajectory? What contributes to it?
    - looks good $\implies$ strengths 
    - looks bad or unsatisfactory $\implies$ weaknesses
- Feared trajectory (shocks, risks, macro environment, competition): 
    - scenario looks bad $\implies$ threats
- Desired trajectory. Is it reasonable and realistically achievable? 
    - if yes $\implies$ opportunities

::::

::: {.aside}
Discussion: There are better tools than SWOT, coming from management consulting.
:::

## We can't avoid tradeoffs

- What if it's a startup that received big funding?
- What if it wants to capture market share?
- What if the goal is to have sustainable profitability?
- What if they position themselves as luxury?

> The question we asked is too generic. We need a **strategy** and possible decisions, constraints in their **value chain**

::: {.aside}
What is the optimal tradeoff between objectives? In which part of value chain should they take action?

## Business Analysts' Workflow


![*Source: [Adam Fleischhacker](https://causact.com)*; This process is highly iterative and depends on having good feedback and collaboration](img/analyst-workflow.png "Analysis"){width="90%"}

## Characteristics of this process

- **Outcome-focused**: What's the point otherwise?
- **Strategically-aligned**: Not all outcomes are equal!
- **Action-oriented**: Biggest pitfall of any AI/ML initiative -- when it's not actionable!
    - Needs clear and persuasive communication
- **Computationally rigorous**: 
    - Correctness, reproducibility and maintainability
    - Accesible: idealy in an app which users explore

::: {.aside}
Data scientists often forget about outcomes and actionability. Students get stuck in EDA
:::

## What is a strategy anyways?

NOT just **aspiration** towards goal or a **vision** or a **target**.

| Step | Outcome | Characteristics
|------|-------|------|
| Honest diagnosis | Identify obstacles |     Few critical, relevant aspects
| Guiding policy |  General approach to overcome obstacles | Focus on most promising
| Coherent actions | Support policy with action plan   |  Coordinated and focused

::: {.aside}
When it comes to setting good goals, you might've heard of SMART
:::


## Other methodologies to be aware of

- Statistics and experiment design (12 steps)
    - The scientific process is much larger than this
- CRISP-DM, Tuckey's Exploratory Data Analysis
- Machine Learning (12 steps)
- Causal inference and probabilistic graphs
- Software Development: Agile, DDD, TDD, XP
- AI Products: People+AI, AI Governance

::: {.aside}
Methodologies are NOT recipes, NOR bureaucracy.

## Value Chain meets Decision Science

## Roles in firms: stuff data people do

- Data Engineering -- pipelines and infrastructure
- Data Analysts -- detectives, decision support
- BI -- infrastructure for reporting, clean, modeled data
- ML Engineer -- builds ML models and deploys them
- Data Scientist -- jack of all trades, often lots of stats
- Product Analyst -- cares about experiments
- Decision Makers & Domain Experts are usually the clients

::: {.aside}
Everyone deals with data, even BE, FE, Decision-Makers, QA, DevOPS, domain experts
:::



## Remark on course philosophy

- Why is something important (method, idea, model ...)
- Develop conceptual understanding and intuition
    - Theoretical rigor only where necessary
- Use simulations as a safe playground
- Practical and realistic applications
    - problem formulation: focus on decision-making
    - start with simplest models
    - deal with messy data and introduce more realism

::: {.aside}
There is no shame in going back to the fundamentals to master them

## The danger of thinking in buckets

Here is R. Sapolsky's argument about studying different aspects of human behavior:

- Our brains think about stuff in buckets / boundaries
- These buckets influence our memory, language, behavior
- We stop seeing the big picture:
    - Bad at differentiating facts within buckets
    - Exagerrate differences between buckets
- Tempting to claim that a bucket is the only, true explanation
- Some of the most influential scientists fell into this trap

## We'll walk across many buckets

- **Problem space**: the CAS of a firm, but not only
- **Cognitive science**: intelligence, rationality, foolishness
- **Probability Theory**: Reason under uncertainty, DAGs, DGPs
- **Statistics**: formulating hypotheses, experiment design
- **Machine Learning**: next year we focus on predictions
- **Computer Science**: how to make the stuff usable
- **Philosophy**: ethics, epistemiology, phil. science
- **Mathematics**: elegant abstractions and tools
