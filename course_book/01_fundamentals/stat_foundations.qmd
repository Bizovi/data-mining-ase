# Statistical Foundations

In order to be a successful Data Scientist, one has to speak the language of probability and statistics. It is the foundation on which we can build towards more realistic and avanced models, with the purpose of improving **decision-making under uncertainty**. This foundation is a prerequisite for all three perspectives: analytics/mining, machine learning and causal inference.

> In order to build adequate models of economic and other complex phenomena, we have to take into account their inherent *stochastic nature*. 

Data is just the appearance, an external manifestation of some `latent processes` (seen as random mechanisms). Even though we won't know the exact outcome for sure, we can model general regularities and relationships as a result of the large scale of phenomena.

## A word of encouragement

Reviewing the fundamentals of statistics doesn't have to be boring! We can put "the classics" in context of modern statistics, big data challenges, and use simulation instead of heavy mathematics and proof-based approaches.

Moreover, theoretical ideas underlying statistical practice, which we often take for granted, deserve an explicit articulation. This will improve our awareness, understanding, and grasp of the field -- such that we can become more effective practitioners.

The plan for this lecture is the following: we start by constructing the probability triple, formalize sources of uncertainty, and investigate the building blocks of a statistical model. I then highlight in a few case-studies what can go wrong in the process of statistical inference and how difficult it is to choose the right model. The most technical, heavy, and mathematical part is about estimators and their properties, but it is necessary both for hypothesis testing and machine learning. To make it more accessigle and intuitive, we will use simulation and visualization during the labs to get an understanding and intuition on how estimators behave. We wrap up the lecture by looking at the statistical process in firms and put it in contrast with the process for ML, predictive systems. Last, but not least, there is one more cautionary tale about multiple testing -- which will be our gateway into truly modern statistics.

## Complementary resources if you feel like starting over
- Realize that lots of common statistical tests are particular versions of linear models [^11]. It takes a few hours to go through the theory and the code in the referenced book.
- Here's the approach taken by [^24], which integrates data analysis and simulation in learning of statistics.
- Upgrade your statistical thinking for the 21st century challenges and be aware of the pitfalls and problems in the field. A good reference is [^12], which takes multiple perspectives (frequentist, bayesian, causal inference), while going through the workhorse models and methods.
- Be comfortable with exploring, wrangling, visualizing and analyzing data in R or/and Python, get familiar with reproducible research best practices. A good starting point is [^45], which is a course in collaboration with the RStudio team.

There are a gazillion books, courses on statistics, which basically do/teach the same thing. For reference and your curiosity, I curated a few which stand out with the right balance of data, code, simulation, theoretical rigor and real-world applications:

- Cetinkaya-Runde, Hardin - [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/index.html) goes through all the fundamentals in a clear, concrete, extensive way, with code!
- Crump - [Answering questions with data](https://www.crumplab.com/statistics/) -- introductory statistics for Psychology Students has an interesting approach, focused on the challenges of Psychology
- Thulin - [Modern Statistics with R](http://www.modernstatisticswithr.com/) goes through the whole process, with R, with additional topics, normally not present in a statistics course 
- Holmes, Huber - [Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/index.html) is for biologists, but we can see how central to the field are multidimensional methods, clustering and high-performance computing, working with big and messy data

## The probability triple

In the [previous lecture](background.qmd#why-did-you-study-all-of-that), I mentioned why did we study probability theory. However, there is one more useful metaphor: remember how important is logic in mathematics, computer science, and philosophy; it's one of the prerequisites in each of those, an essential tool for reasoning. Then, probability theory is the **logic of uncertainty**, a formal language. [^fuzzy]

[^fuzzy]: If you studied fuzzy set theory, you might have a case for it being the candidate, however, it fell out of favor in practice -- so I would suggest to focus on probability and Bayesian reasoning. 


Often, probability and mathematical statistics are bundled together, as they make perfect sense in sequence, but they have different objectives in mind. Probability theory is concerned with the construction of the probability triple $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$, defining useful tools like random variables and probability/cumulative density functions, extending those to joint, conditional probabilities. Then, introducing the machinery to operate all of that, like expectation, variance, moment-generating functions -- in order to reason about distributional properties.


1. A **random experiment** ($\mathscr{E}$) is a set of *conditions which are favorable for an event* in a given form with the following properties:
    - Possible results and outcomes are known apriori and exhaustably, for example a coin/die toss, quantity sold
    - It's never known which of the results of $\mathscr{E}$ will manifest or appear once we run the experiment
    - Despite that, **there is a perceptible regularity**, which can be eventually measured and quantified, that is, encoding the idea of a probabilistic "law" in the results. That regularity could be a result of the large scale of the phenomena.
    - Repeatability of the conditions in which the experiment runs, like the comparability and perservation of context. This is optional in the Bayesian perspective, where we're not thinking in long-run frequency terms. 
2. **Elementary event** as an auxiliaty construction: one of the possible results of $\mathscr{E}$, usually conventionally denoted by $\omega_i \in \Omega$
3. **Universal set**  $\Omega = \{ \omega_1, \omega_2, \dots \}$  is also called (Outcome/ State/ Selection space). It suggests the idea of complementarity and stochasticity: we don't know which $\omega_i$ will manifest, thus is a key object for a further formalization of probability measures. 
4. We care not only about **an event** $A = \bigcup\limits_{i = 1}^n \omega_i$ and its realization, but also about other events in the Universal Set, because they might contribute with additional information (about the probability) of our event of interest. This means that we we're interested in "all" other events.
5. The **event space** $\mathcal{F}$ is a sigma-algebra, should be defined on sets of subsets of $\Omega$ and this is where measure theory shines. For technical reasons, we usually can't define a probability measure on all sets of subsets. On an intuitive note, we define the probability measure on sigma-algebras because if certain conditions did not hold, the measure wouldn't make sense.
6. **Probability as an extension of the measure**: chance of events realizing. Note that the perceptible regularity can be thought as the ability to assign a probability (number between 0 and 1) to elementary events: $\mathbb{P}(\omega_i)$. This is why additivity properties are key, as we care about random events, not only elementary events. This is where the debate between frequentists and Bayesians kicks in.
7. A **probability triple** $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ is the fundamental object the whole probability theory is constructed upon. We have to thank Kolmogorov for taking the informal, gambling-type probability and putting it onto solid, axiomatic foundations -- that is, making it open to mathematical enquiry.


::: {.column-margin}
**Def: Algebra and Sigma-Algebra**

 A set of subsets $\mathcal{A} \subset 2^\Omega$ is an algebra (field) if the following holds:

1. $\Omega \in \mathcal{A}$ and $\varnothing \in \mathcal{A}$
2. If $A \in \mathcal{A}$ then $A^C \in \mathcal{A}$ (closed under complements)
3. If $A, B \in \mathcal{A}$ then $A \cup B \in \mathcal{A}$ (closed under union). Note that 2 and 3 imply that it's closed under countable intersection
4. The additional condition for sigma-algebra: **sigma** refers to countability. If $\{  A_i \}_{i \ge 1} \in \mathcal{A}$ then $\bigcup\limits_{i \ge 1} A_i \in \mathcal{A}$ (closed under **countable union**)
:::

::: {.column-margin}

**Def: Probability Measure**	

Suppose we have defined a **measurable space** $(\Omega, \mathcal{A})$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is a sigma-algebra. A **probability measure** is the function $\mathbb{P}:\mathcal{A} \rightarrow [0, 1]$ such that:

1. $\mathbb{P}(\Omega) = 1$ 	\footnote{From 1 and 2 it can be derived that $\mathbb{P}(\varnothing) = 0$ and $\mathbb{P}(A^C) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(A)$}
2. For countable sequences of mutually disjoint effects, i.e. $\forall \{ A_i \}_{i \ge 1}$ where $A_i \bigcap\limits_{i \ne j} A_j = \varnothing$, the following holds $\mathbb{P}(\bigcup\limits_{i \ge 1} A_i) = \sum\limits_{i \ge 1} \mathbb{P}(A_i)$

:::

:::: {.callout-note}
## Measure theory rabbit hole: Why not all subsets?
The reasons for this are very technical, and the concept of a sigma-algebra is essential in resolving the resulting paradoxes. If you're interested in these technical details, you can check out my relatively accessible introudction to [measure theory and the Caratheodori extension theorem](https://blog.economic-cybernetics.com/post/2018-06-01-probabiliy/).  

::: {.column-margin}
Jeffrey Rosenthal begins his book by a similar motivation, constructing the following random variable as a coin toss between a discrete $X \sim Pois(\lambda)$ and continuous $Y \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ r.v.

\marginnote{
	\begin{equation*}
	\mathbb{P}(X = k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^k}{k!} 
	\end{equation*}
	
	\begin{equation*}
	\mathbb{P}(a \le Y \le b) = \int_{a}^{b} dy \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} exp(-\frac{y^2}{2})
	\end{equation*}
}

\begin{equation}
	Z = \begin{cases}
	X, p = 0.5 \\
	Y, p = 0.5
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

He then challenges the readers to come up with the expected value $\mathbb{E}[Z^2]$ and asks on what is it defined? It is indeed a hard question.
:::

Even though you can go a long way as a practitioner with standard tools in probability theory, deeply understanding its **measure-theoretic** foundations could open up a whole new world to the researcher. It's easy to take the results from statistics and probability for granted, but it's useful to be aware what hides beneath the surface.

Evans Lawrence gives the following example of a function which is neither discrete nor continuous, for which you flip a coin and if it comes heads, draw from an uniform distribution and in case of tails a unit mass at one. If $\chi_{[0,1]}(x) = (e^{ix} - 1)/ix$ is the characteristic function of the interval from zero to one, in a way you can formulate its density, but usually it's not the case, nor is it very helpful to think about it in such terms.

\begin{equation}
	p(x) = w_1 \chi_{[0,1]}(x) +  w_2\delta_1(x)
\end{equation}

Even though you can visualize this in two dimensions as the uniform and a spike, or as a CDF with a discontinuity, this approach just breaks down in higher dimensions or more complicated combinations of functions.
::::

Thank you for bearing with me through the theory you have probably seen before, but we're not done. We're still in the land of set theory, and it is very hard to operate that way in practice -- so, we need a new concept which will allow us to use the tools of mathematical analysis in probability, in order to make it feasible for practical uses.

## The breakthrough idea of a Random Variable

We started from some phenomena of interest and a random experiment. The random variable is a necessary abstraction in order to mathematically define quantifiable characteristics of the objects. Meaning, we start working with numbers instead of some qualitative properties. Now, we're in business!
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## Random Variable is not a variable, nor random

A random variable is quantificator of elementary events, a function defined on the outcome space which maps the elementary events to the real number line. That mapping can't be done in any way we wish, it has to perserve the informational structure of the sample space. That is one of the technical reasons for sigma-algebras we mentioned before and is related to the idea of **measurability**.


\begin{align}
X(\omega):\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \\
s.t. ~~ \{\omega \in \Omega | X(\omega) \leq r, \forall r \in \mathbb{R} \} \in \mathcal{F}
\end{align}

:::

Let's figure out what the hell do we mean by that fine print condition, using the diagram below. The idea of conservation of the informational structure is actually equivalent to the one of measurablility. If this property doesn't hold, it's not possible to explicitly and uniquely refer to the sets (events) of interest.

The idea is that the preimage defined above $X^{-1}((-\infty,r]) = E \in \mathcal{F}$ on the following interval corresponds to an event E which should be in the event space $\mathcal{F}$. Because the only thing that varies is the limit of the interval r, the randomness comes from it. Also, it automatically suggests the idea of the Cumulative Distribution Function, which is $F_X(X \le r)$.

::: {.column-margin}
CDF, one of the most important constructs in probability is a direct consequence of the definition of the random variable:

$$
P(A ≤ r) = F_X(X ≤ r)
$$

In the practice of modeling, we often work with probability density functions, because it is more convenient in many cases. Then, in order to translate to probabilities, we would think in terms of areas under that curve. For sure, you remember the following duality between CFD and PDF:

$$
F'(x) = p(x)
$$

As a motivation of why do we have to understand all of this, when for most practical applications we can get by just fine with using the results and tools from probability, I will introduce two examples: one of componsitional data analysis[^cda] and time series analysis. What I want to say, is that for more "exotic" applications, we might need to tweak that probability triple because of the nature of the problem, which has downstream consequences for all the statistical machinery we use in those applications.


::: {.callout-tip}
## The curious case of Compositional Data Analysis

Sometimes, the data doesn't "live" in our normal, intuitive, euclidian space 
$\mathbb{R}^n$. There are cases when the object of our analysis are proportions or compositions: think of what a material is made of, the proportion of the demand for different sizes of a shoe or garment.

We don't necessarily care about their absolute value, but about their relative proportion. If we blindly apply traditional methods, or even statistical summaries, we will quickly hit weird results and paradoxes. So, we have to tweak existing methods we have make sense for compositions.

Compositional data analysis solves those issues by defining a probability triple over the simplex (instead of $\mathbb{R}^n$): $(\mathcal{S}^n, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$. This leads to a different definition of the event space $\mathcal{F}$, which is also a sigma-algebra and a different definition of the probability measure $\mathbb{P}$. 
:::

Remember our exaple of [pigeon superstition](background.qmd#implicit-learning-intuition-and-bias) in the context of learning? It is not surprising to me that measure theory becomes important in Learning Theory,[^ml-measure] which is exatly those carefully formulated principles that will prevent our automated learners to become supersitious. 

[^ml-measure]: Even though most courses from which I studied don't mention it explicitly (Yaser Abu-Mostafa, Shai Ben-David, Reza Shadmehr), according to Mikio's Brown [answer](https://www.quora.com/Is-Measure-Theory-relevant-to-Machine-Learning/answer/Mikio-L-Braun?srid=KONR) it's essential in the idea of **uniform convergence** and its bounds, where *"you consider the probability of a supremum over an infinite set of functions, but out of the box measure theory only allows for constructions with countably infinite index sets"*. 

For the next example, you don't have to understand what Gaussian Processes are or are used for. However, later in the course, we will discuss nonparametric methods for hypothesis testing. Their usefulness comes from the fact that we make less distributional assumptions about our population, therefore getting more robust results, in contrast with choosing a wrong model or distribution. 

It's not that these methods don't have parameters, but the parametrization varies depending on how much data we have, which makes them very flexible in a wide variety of applications, where we just don't know what is a reasonable distribution or parametric functional form for the relationship that we model.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Nonparametrics and Gaussian Processes
<!-- Stochastic Processes, Graphs and Trees -->
If we're thinking about a regression from the nonparametric perspective: that is, over a set of abstract functions: $f(x) \in \mathscr{C}^2:X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, [^gp] we might want to know how a draw of samples from an infinite set of continuous differentiable functions might look like. 

$$
f(x) \sim GP(\mu(x); K(x,x'))
$$

The questions arises: how to define a PDF (probability density function) in this space? In my bachelor thesis, I got away with using Gaussian Processes, which are a very special class of stochastic processes. In this special case I could informally define an apriori distribution by defining the mean vector and Kernel (covariance function), then condition it on observed data with a Normal Likelihood. 

$$
p(f(x) \, |\left \{ x\right \})=\frac{p(\left \{ x\right \}| \, f) \, \mathbf{p(f)}}{p(\left \{ x\right \})}
$$

:::

[^gp]: ![*Source: [Bizovi](https://blog.economic-cybernetics.com/post/2018-06-01-probabiliy/)*: A posterior distribution of the Gaussian Processes, when conditioned on data](img/gp-conditioned.png "GP Posterior"){width="90%"}

::: {.column-margin}
In the case of stochastic processes, we work with a sequence of random variables $\{X_t, t \in T \}$ and start asking questions:

- What kind of time dependency is there? (autocorrelation)
- What is the long-run behavior?
- Can we say something about extreme events?
:::

A lot of important applications in economics and finance are dynamic, so we have to work with time series very often. It gets worse when data is correlated not only in time, but also geographically -- which is why the field of spatio-temporal data analysis is in such demand right now for policy-making.

Thus, a natural extension of this probability machinery we discussed so far is stochastic processes, underlying these dynamical systems. We can look at our time series as a manifestation, a particular instantiation of this latent process. Depending on which one we choose, we can model a wide range of phenomena.



### Sources of Uncertainty

In the last chapter, we raised the issue of [where does uncertainty come from](background.qmd#what-is-ai-data-science-cybernetics-), mentioning that this question deserves further investigation. In order to do that, we will take an AI, Decision-Making, or Reinforcement Learning perspective, rather than a statistical or econometric one.

Think of **agents** who act and interact with their environment and have particular objectives or payoffs. Hopefully, they act in an intelligent way to achieve their goals in time. Given a past sequence of observations $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_t)$ and knowledge about the environment, the agent has to choose an action that best achieves its objectives in the presence of various sources of uncertainty. [^dm]

[^dm]: This paragraph is taken from the brilliant, open book [Algorithms for Decision Making, MIT Press - 2022](https://algorithmsbook.com/) by M. Kochenderfer, T. Wheeler, and K. Wray

- **Outcome uncertainty**, as the consequences and effects of actions are uncertain. Can we be sure that an intervention works out? We can't take everything into account when making a decision -- it becomes combinatorialy explosive.
- **Model uncertainty**, that is we can't be sure that our understanding, model as a simplification of reality is the right one. In decision-making, we often mis-frame problems and in statistics, well, choose the wrong model.
- **State uncertainty** was discussed at length before, where the true state of the environment is uncertain and moreover, everything changes and is in flux.
- **Interaction uncertainty**, due to the behavior of the other agents interacting in the environment. For example, competitive firms, social network effects.

We will focus very little on this last aspect of uncertainty, but you have some tools to reason about it: game-theoretic arguments, ideas from multi-agent systems and agent-based modeling in cybernetics, and finally, graph theory. I think it is an important dimension of reality, however, taking it into account in this course would make it incomparably more complicated and advanced.

### Joint, Conditional, and Marginal Distributions
<!-- 
[The reason we went on a theoretical detour to construct the probability triple, was simply to raise awareness of what is the theory that stands behind probability as we will practice it and what are some situations when handwaving could bite us]{.aside}

The point of this course is not to be a comprehensive investigation into probability theory topics like moment-generating functions, expectation, variance, etc. If I stirred your interest and renewed a passion for these topics, feel free to refer to the additional resources in the beginning of the lecture.

Starting point: unconditional probability degree of belief in a proposition in the absence of any other evidence -->



<!-- The most complete method of reasoning about sets of random variables is by having a joint probability distribution. A joint probability distribution, , assigns a probability value to all possible assignments or realizations of sets of random variables.  -->
<!-- 
In the diagram, there are four random variables: 1) Interest Rate , 2) Stock Market , 3) Oil Industry , and 4) Stock Price  (assume for an oil company). The arrows between the random variables tell a story of precedence and causal direction: interest rate influences the stock market which then, in combination with the state of the oil industry will determine the stock price (we will learn more about these arrows in the Graphical Models chapter). For simplicity and to gain intuition about joint distributions, assume that each of these four random variables is binary-valued, meaning they can each take two possible assignments:


Thus, our probability space has  values corresponding to the possible assignments to these four variables. So, a joint distribution must be able to assign probability to these 16 combinations. Here is one possible joint distribution:

Collectively, the above 16 probabilities represent the joint distribution  - meaning, you plug in values for all four random variables and it gives you a probability. For example,  yields a probability assignment of 12.15%.


Notation note:  . Each defines a function where you supply realizations  and  and the probability function will return . For example, let  outcome of a dice roll and  outcome of a coin flip. Hence, you can supply potential outcomes, like  which means  and the function output would be

<!-- 
importance of the data generating process, see what Ernesto said, then the causal process -- all is parameters, known or unknown 

Uses everything probability has to give, but is concerned with inference, estimation, hypothesis testing, prove theorems and probabilistic properties of estimators.

- Collectivity (can be anything, trees in central park, pixels, people, etc, etc) -- i.e stuff in the real world
- Statistical Population (binding contract)
- Sample (a data collection process is involved here)
- Parameter (average tree height, some aspect or characteristic of interest, unknown number/constant (bayes, a distribution), which is at population level) -- of the DGP, to be estimated from our sample.
- Estimator: t_theta(X) -> theta
	- Confidence intervals: depend on the distribution of the estimator, since X is rv, t(X) is a random variable too -- and it is the job of statisticians to tell us what is that P(t(X)) and their properties: if biased, consistent, efficient
- Estimation/a Statistic: theta_hat (a way to summarise and synthetise data)

Draw a diagram between sample and population.

The point of statistics: change our opinion about the action we have (or phenomenon we want to understand) to take in the face of evidence.

One big problem is if we got the model right for our use-case and phenomena. A wrong model choice leads to wrong conclusions. It should be informed as much by stats as by the theory and domain. Think of this in the spirit of the scientific method. -->

<!-- Data + Domain Assumptions + Statistical Assumptions -->

### Model Specification: Fisher vs Bayes


### Independence and Exchangeability
<!-- 
I find it useful to review **exchangeability** and De Finetti's theorem, before presenting the components of a Bayesian model, as it gives a sense of what is the underlying assumption of Hierarchical Models. 

A sequence of random variables is infinitely exchangeable if the joint probability for every set of $n$ variables is invariant under permutation of indices. De Finetti's theorem, states that a sequence of random variables $(y_1, y_2, ...)$, with $P(d\theta)$ -- a measure, is exchangeable if and only if:

\begin{equation}
	p(y_1, ..., y_n) = \int \prod_{i=1}^{n} p(y_i | \theta) P(d\theta)
\end{equation}


It follows that there exists a parameter $\theta$, a distribution on $\theta$ and a likelihood $p(y_i | \theta)$ such that the random variable sequence is independent. Covariates can be incorporated into the formulation and theorem applied again for a vector of parameters $\theta$, which resembles the hierarchical formulation introduced in section 3. Thus, there exists a:

- hyperparameter $\phi$
- a distribution over the hyperparameter $p(\phi | \mathbf{x})$
- likelihood $p(\theta | \phi, \mathbf{x})$ such that $\theta_i$ are independent when drawn from this distribution


These facts highlight the elegance of the hierarchical models, where hyperprior distribution is learned from data and can be marginalized in the case it's a nuisance parameter for a particular analysis. However, de Finetti's theorem doesn't give any prescription on how these priors should be chosen, only that they exist, so best practices in literature should be consulted and appropriateness given the problem at hand assessed.



\begin{equation}
	p(\theta | y) \propto \int d\phi ~ p(y | \theta) p(\theta | \phi) p(\phi) 
\end{equation}


Bayesian models are usually built and formulated in a modular way, which forces the modeler to make stochastic and structural assumptions explicit. Because of the fact that formulation captures conditional independencies, it is interesting to view the model as a graph, where nodes are random variables, observed quantities and (directed) edges influences and information flows. The process of Bayesian Inference satisfies at once a few requirements: the ability to update prior beliefs once new data is available, combining different sources of information, modeling the data generating process and quantifying uncertainty in estimates. Let $D = \{ (x_i, y_i) \}_{i=1}^n$ be the data, then the iterative model update works according to the Bayes Rule:

\begin{equation}
 \overbrace{p(\theta | X, y)}^\text{posterior} = \frac{\overbrace{p(\theta | X)}^\text{prior} \cdot \overbrace{p(y | \theta, X)}^\text{likelihood} }{ p(y | X) }
\end{equation}


The posterior can be used as a prior when new data is available and iteratively updating it. This consistency is useful when constructing priors using literature, previous experiments, ``online`` learning and doing meta-analyses. In a business setting, it is an important property in order to capture changes in the phenomena modeled, but avoiding the (possible) instability related to re-training complex machine learning models.

\begin{equation}
 p(\theta' | X', y') = \frac{p(\theta | X, y) \cdot p(y' | \theta')}{p(y'|\theta, X')}
\end{equation}

Since the model is generative, i.e. after building a full probabilistic model of the data, parameters and latent variables, it is useful not only to infer and summarize parameter distributions, but to generate data as a tool for checking assumptions made. In this regard, prior and posterior predictive distributions are most often used in literature. Sampling using the marginal distribution of the observed value, before fitting any data, gives a sense on what kind of patterns, in which range, with what spread can the priors and likelihood specify.

\begin{equation}
	p(y) = \int d\theta ~ p(\theta) p(y | \theta) 
\end{equation}


To make a prediction/inference regarding an unobserved or new value $\tilde{y}$ given the posterior distribution of parameters $p(\theta | y)$, they are marginalized. I will extensively use this technique throughout the next chapters and summarize this distributions with ``credible intervals``.

\begin{equation}
	p(\tilde{y} | y) = \int d\theta ~ \underbrace{p(\tilde{y} | \theta, y)}_\text{likelihood} \cdot  \underbrace{p(\theta | y)}_\text{posterior}
\end{equation}


Latent variables and parameters are treated the same in Bayesian Modeling and dealing with missing data is more natural than in Statistical Learning, because it is viewed as an unobserved value and will have a posterior predictive distribution, as a part of the sampling process. Moreover, if the data is Missing Not at Random, this mechanism can be modeled explicity, but needs more informative priors about the nature of missingness. \cite{best12} has an excellent overview of approaches regarding missing targets or covariates and summarize it with the following graphical models, where $m_i$ is an indicator variable in the case $y_i$ is missing.


The representation in figure above is a Probabilistic Graphical Model, which is a directed acyclic graph, where nodes are observed, unobserved variables and parameter, edges are logical or stochastic dependencies. An important way of thinking about causality was pioneered by Judea Pearl, which concerns itself with inference of the graph from data and factorization of joint distribution. Two ideas are relevant for this dissertation: Reichenbach's common cause principle, \cite{reichen62} and the idea of counterfactual formalized by Rubin.

- If $X$ and $Y$ are statistically dependent, there exists $Z$ causally influencing both.
- Given a ``chain`` $X \rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y$, X and Y are conditionally independent on Z: $(X \perp Y) ~|~ Z$

In Bayesian statistics conventional definitions of identifiability do not apply, so I'm more concerned with ``information contents`` given a model and particular dataset. If a posterior distribution of some parameter is flat over a large range, it is an indication that little was learned from data relative to prior information. Viewing indentifiability as the posterior being proper is not very useful in practice, as there isn't a need to even define a finite variance or mean.
Model critique, improvement and visualization \cite{gabry19} play a key role in the Bayesian workflow, since a large amount of time is spent summarizing models and finding appropriate prior and structural specifications. As A. Gelman mentioned, ``Bayes doesn't give up``, when conventional methods would refuse to estimate the parameters, which implies it is the modeler's responsibility to challenge the model and check assumptions, find ways of better parametrization. In the last decades, the focus has shifted from the mathematical analysis to computational methods as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, INLA, Variational Inference, which enable a great deal of experimentation with model specifications. Next chapters follow this spirit, favoring intuition and understanding over analytical tractability and focus on mathematical aspects which are really important for building models with ``nice`` properties. -->

### De Moivre on US Schooling
<!-- 
Let's remember what we discusssed last time. So, the US gov, tried to find out what makes some schools better than others. They saw that in top schools, small ones were dominating (in terms of nr students, perf. being SAT ~ Norm()). 

They decided to split up big schools into smaller ones. Can you say if it was a good, bad idea and why did they think that?

Students hypothesis:
- more attention to students in smaller classrooms
- private schools, where families are more wealthy
- geographical location, i.e. small towns and villages
- motivation of the underdog, from small towns
- friendships, community and peer competition (easier in smaller schools)
- self-selection: what kind of students go into small schools -- we assume average IQ is the same, including the distribution. Assume random allocation. 
- Skewed (even if not, longer tails): meaning, asymmetric distributions. 
- Finally: variance and standard deviation

About the decision sanity: reality vs data. The conservative decision is to do nothing, as restructuring costs a lot, in money and social changes & consequences, it is risky -- that is, the default action, without seeing any data or evidence, we would do nothing. 

S: A good remark about having a diversity, specializations (professional schools) -- can't have a one-size-fits-it-all policy. But we ignore it, oversimplifying the problem.

All of that is true, but just for 10 minutes, we introduce a (false) dichotomy between small and large schools. The alternative is to split big school -- remember, that outside this box, or bad framing of the problem, there are many many potential interventions (professor education, smaller classrooms, fairer allocation of students, raising up the disadvantaged hood schools). 

The punchline: we have all these factors potentially contributing to the performance. Because of DeMoivre and LLN (mean/sqrt(sd)) -- in a simulation, we notice the following thing: (insert graphs).

> Small schools will dominate both the top and bottom, due to larger variance. This is what it means. 

So, we go back to this idea that statistical models, are golemns, they do exactly what they are told to, and this is dangerous. We have to understand deeply in what contexts and in which ways these little robots fail and give absurd and invalid results without us knowing.

We will go into more detail next week in A/B testing and hypothesis testing, but here we go: once we have the default action and the alternative action, the null hypothesis is (sidenote, we don't care about rote calculation -- R packages does it for us, but we care about experiment design and decisions, try to figure out the causal influences):  in which worlds will I take the default actions (worlds, meaning the values of the unknown parameter of interest, describing the behavior of the populations -- in this case quantifying the impact of school size on SAT scores). The alternative hypothesis, is exactly the opposite, all the other worlds (parameter values) when I will take the alternative action.

So, in this case we will collect data, used to estimate the parameter and its confidence intervels (inference, with the idea of generalizing from the sample to the population). Now, given those confidence intervals, we ask how surprising it is to see the data/estimation, if the null hypothesis was true.

Most stats courses jump over these important aspects. Their starting point is: H0, HA are given, model is given, you just compute. In practice, even for experienced statistician, for a new problem, it is very hard to define those 4 components -- as it depends on the domain knowledge and business objectives. Moreover, even the interpretation of p-values is extremely tricky to communicate. We will develop tools to deal with those challenges.  -->

### Chess example
<!-- I played chess for 14 years, professionally, question about difference in genders and what kind of tournaments and policies should we have. Why are there no women rn in top 100 (Historically, it was judit polgar in the top 20) ?

> Use this chance to extract data and analyse. Same problem with marathon runners (from BS big data). 

Causes?
- Bias: inferring natural ability -- nonsense from IQ research
- Misoginism
- Education and lack of encouragement
- Lack of opportunities, community, support
- Historical trajectory -- lack of competition

A lot is explained by how many boys and girls start from a given cohort/age. Similar problem, but slightly different -- for any problem of rank top(n).

We will discuss next time a whole range of other pitfalls, including spurious correlation (nicolas cage and drowning), common cause (babies and storks), ommited variables, mediation, selection bias, reverse causality, even including predictors which shouldn't be there. We need a statistical reasoning for all of these potential pitfalls. 

> explore python cli app + scraping + arrow + duckdb, see the trajectories of players and so on (chess.com vs fide). For the trajectories, mention the idea of longitudinal data, survival models, growth models, mixed models -- because of the particularities of DGP and causal process 

> see the difference between ELO vs xbox true skill, how fast it converges to the true ability -- that is a model we can investigate.  -->

### Amazon reviews and ratings
<!-- How do you choose 4.7 (300) vs 4.5 (2000) -- according to what bounds, agresti-coull, correction. What chance do you give those with a small sample size? What is the optimal strategy here?

- we can guide ourselfs with the quality and relevance of reviews
- is it representative? (also, outside the box)
- text summary

Q: What is the variance and distribution, it depends, also on our risk appetites (w.r.t.) volume or if is one time (e.g. buy shoes vs coffee shops -- repeated interactions).

Introduce the confusion matrix, which will be discussed at length in ML and hypothesis testing (types of error) -- the point is that sometimes the payoff for correct decison or a mistake is asymmetric. And that matters (fraud vs reco quality) -- so, that is context-dependent. 

> good applications for text mining, statistical tests -->

## Data Mining and CRISP-DM variants


### ML is a geocentric model of the universe
<!-- 
The good news is that sometimes, you just need a reliable prediction, as you're not intervening in the system causing a certain phenomena -- and by retraining ML models you can adapt to minor changes introduced by our interventions. Those ML models, they clearly didn't figure out a scientific explanation of the causal process, e.g. for demand forecasting in uber, and that just the prediction to be used in a larger ecosystem and environment for decision-making. 

Again, that is appropriate in low-stakes, large scale decisons. You might not care so much about the latent, causal process; but of course, you care that it generalizes to the population of interest (that is, a binding contract, a boundary in which your predictions are valid -- if you go outside that range, can easily get absurd predictions -- this is why this kind of system needs checks-and-balances, boxes to constrain the artificial stupidity). It is extraordinarily unlikely that these models translate to novel situations and environments without explicit transfer learning and careful adaptation.  -->
