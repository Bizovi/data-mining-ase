# Statistical Foundations: WIP

In order to be a successful Data Scientist, one has to speak the language of probability and statistics. It is the foundation on which we can build towards more realistic and avanced models, with the purpose of improving **decision-making under uncertainty**. This foundation is a prerequisite for all three perspectives: analytics/mining, machine learning and causal inference.

> In order to build adequate models of economic and other complex phenomena, we have to take into account their inherent *stochastic nature*. 

Data is just the appearance, an external manifestation of some `latent processes` (seen as random mechanisms). Even though we won't know the exact outcome for sure, we can model general regularities and relationships as a result of the large scale of phenomena.

## A word of encouragement

Reviewing the fundamentals of statistics doesn't have to be boring! We can put "the classics" in context of modern statistics, big data challenges, and use simulation instead of heavy mathematics and proof-based approaches.

Moreover, theoretical ideas underlying statistical practice, which we often take for granted, deserve an explicit articulation. This will improve our awareness, understanding, and grasp of the field -- such that we can become more effective practitioners.

The plan for this lecture is the following: we start by constructing the probability triple, formalize sources of uncertainty, and investigate the building blocks of a statistical model. I then highlight in a few case-studies what can go wrong in the process of statistical inference and how difficult it is to choose the right model. The most technical, heavy, and mathematical part is about estimators and their properties, but it is necessary both for hypothesis testing and machine learning. To make it more accessigle and intuitive, we will use simulation and visualization during the labs to get an understanding and intuition on how estimators behave. We wrap up the lecture by looking at the statistical process in firms and put it in contrast with the process for ML, predictive systems. Last, but not least, there is one more cautionary tale about multiple testing -- which will be our gateway into truly modern statistics.





Therefore, here's a guide on how to refresh the statistical knowledge, in such a way, that statistics becomes fascinating, not boring and frustrating.

- Realize that lots of common statistical tests are particular versions of linear models [^11]. It takes a few hours to go through the theory and the code in the referenced book.
- Understand the following concepts:
	- Random Experiments, Contructing the probability triple, Random variables and CDFs
	- Collectivity, Statistical Population, Samples and Sampling (as a process)
	- Parameter, Estimator, Estimation: properties of estimators (i.e. what does a statistician want)
	- Here's the approach taken by [^24], which integrates data analysis and simulation in learning of statistics.
- Upgrade your statistical thinking for the 21st century challenges and be aware of the pitfalls and problems in the field. A good reference is [^12], which takes multiple perspectives (frequentist, bayesian, causal inference), while going through the workhorse models and methods.
- Be comfortable with exploring, wrangling, visualizing and analyzing data in R or/and Python, get familiar with reproducible research best practices. A good starting point is [^45], which is a course in collaboration with the RStudio team.

There are a gazillion books, courses on statistics, which basically do/teach the same thing. For reference and your curiosity, I curated a few which stand out with the right balance of data, code, simulation, theoretical rigor and real-world applications:
- [^25] Cetinkaya-Runde goes through all the fundamentals in a clear, concrete, extensive way, with code!
- [^34] has an interesting approach, focused on the challenges of Psychology
- [^36] goes through the whole process, with R, with additional topics, normally not present in a statistics course 
- [^39] is for biologists, but we can see how central to the field are multidimensional methods, clustering and high-performance computing, working with big and messy data


## The probability triple

Why? Language of uncertainty! Applications everywhere, the only way we can reason logically under uncertainty (fuzzy logic is out of favor, better study bayes).

The reason we need probability theory is that it's a formal language of uncertainty. Even though you can go a long way as a practitioner with standard tools in probability theory, deeply understanding its **measure-theoretic** foundations could open up a whole new world to the researcher. It's easy to take the results from statistics and probability for granted, but it's useful to be aware what hides beneath the surface. 

Often, probability and math stats are bundled together, as they make perfect sense in sequence, but they have different objectives in mind. Prob theory is concerned with the construction of the probability triple (O, F, P), which can get very rigorous and complicated, with measure theory. We define the probability measure, and it matters a lot in which space are we (R^n, simplex, f(R^n) and gauss processes, SP stochastic processes for time series analysis) -- the curious case of compositional data analysis, in which the classical methods have to be tweaked in order to make sense. Explain how we define P on a simple later -- but the main point to remember, that we construct it here. 

Random Variable!

Three additional critical concepts are: joint probability, which is basically the storytelling behind the data generating process,  conditioning (basically reducing uncertainty and adding information) and marginalization (esp of nuisance parameters -- explain what are those). 

- Random experiment: 
	- possible outcomes are known apriori and exhaustibly, e.g. coin toss, sales (Continuous)
	- we don't know which of those will manifest
	- there is a perceptible regularity, which can be eventually measured and quantified
	- conditions of the experiment are repeatable (bayes perspective - not necessary)
- Elementary events {w1, w2}
- Selection space: complementarity of elementary events
- Random Events as union of elementary events, but can't do it in any way I want. 
- Event space: A and its complement(A) has to have a certain consistency, not always possible to have all possible combinations of elementary events -- technical restrictions for continuous R. Why measure theory as a solid foundation, but irrelevant here.
- Probability measure: assigning a number to an event, between 0, 1; that is, it should represent that perceptible regularity, in frequentist terms - long-run frequency of occurences. n(A) / n -> prob; it also has to respect a minimal set of conditions.
- (O, F, P) triple
- Random variable, most interesting ideas: not random, neither a variable, it's a function X(w) -> R, such that it perserves the informational structure of F., i.e. X^-1(r) in F or <= r in R (not any definition of X is valid, can't be arbitrary -- we can come up with a counterexampe -- basically inversable, can recover the right elementary events). It's a quantification: of Events into numbers, essential for all the following machinery of statistics, ML and so on. It is basically the thing which enables us to define the statistical population (some relevant aspect of it to us)! 


![Idea: Norman Wildberger, Gheorghe Ruxanda. A graphical representation of the random variable](img/random_variable.png "Random Variable"){width="90%"}

1. A **random experiment** ($\mathscr{E}$) is a set of *conditions which are favorable for an event* in a given form with the following properties:
    + Possible results are known apriori
    + It's never known which of the results of $\mathscr{E}$ will exactly appear
    + Despite (b), **there is a perceptible regularity**, (encoding the idea of a probabilistic "law") in the results. Also, it could be as a result of the large scale of the phenomena.
    + Repeatability of the conditions, i.e. the comparability and perservation of context are key.
2. **Elementary event** as an auxiliaty construction: one of the possible results of $\mathscr{E}$, $\omega_i \in \Omega$
3. **Universal set**  $\Omega = \{ \omega_1, \omega_2, \dots \}$  Also called (Outcome/ State/ Selection space), it suggests the idea of complementarity and stochasticity: we don't know which $\omega_i$, is a key object for a further formalization of probability measures. 
4. We care not only about **an event** $A = \bigcup\limits_{i = 1}^n \omega_i$ and its realization, but also about other events in the Universal Set, because they might add information about the probability of occurring of our event of interest
5. The **event space** $\mathcal{F}$ should be defined on sets of subsets of $\Omega$ and this is where measure theory shines. We'll discuss later in extensive detail the following conditions on the way to defining sigma-algebras. As can be seen later, we usually can't define a probability measure on all sets of subsets.
6. **Probability as an extension of the measure**: chance of events realizing. Note that the perceptible regularity can be thought as the ability to assign a probability to elementary events: $\mathbb{P}(\omega_i)$. This is where additivity properties are key. A long discussion on Frequentist vs Bayesian interpretation of it can follow from here.
7. A **probability triple** $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$
8. The idea of **Random Variable**




Before moving on to probability measures, it's useful to think about what a random variable really is and does, because formally, it's neither a variable, nor random. That should be another motivation for speaking the language of measure theory.


The idea of the random variable as being a quantificator of elementary events (function defined on the outcome space which maps the elementary events to the real line in 1d) that perserves the informational structure of the sample space is very powerful, is formally defined and related to the idea of **measurability**. 


> Start from some phenomena of interest and a random experiment. The random variable is a necessary abstraction in order to mathematically define quantificable characteristics of the objects.

\begin{align}
X(\omega):\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \\
s.t. ~~ \{\omega \in \Omega | X(\omega) \leq r, \forall r \in \mathbb{R} \} \in \mathcal{F}
\end{align}

The idea of conservation of the informational structure is actually equivalent to the one of measurablility. If this property doesn't hold, it's not possible to explicitly and uniquely refer to the sets (events) of interest. The idea is that the preimage defined above $X^{-1}((-\infty,r]) = E \in \mathcal{F}$ on the following interval corresponds to an event E which should be in the event space $\mathcal{F}$. Because the only thing that varies is the limit of the interval r, the randomness comes from it. Also, it automatically suggests the idea of the Cumulative Distribution Function, which is $F_X(X \le r)$.

## Mathematical Statistics in a nutshell

importance of the data generating process, see what Ernesto said, then the causal process -- all is parameters, known or unknown 

Uses everything probability has to give, but is concerned with inference, estimation, hypothesis testing, prove theorems and probabilistic properties of estimators.

- Collectivity (can be anything, trees in central park, pixels, people, etc, etc) -- i.e stuff in the real world
- Statistical Population (binding contract)
- Sample (a data collection process is involved here)
- Parameter (average tree height, some aspect or characteristic of interest, unknown number/constant (bayes, a distribution), which is at population level) -- of the DGP, to be estimated from our sample.
- Estimator: t_theta(X) -> theta
	- Confidence intervals: depend on the distribution of the estimator, since X is rv, t(X) is a random variable too -- and it is the job of statisticians to tell us what is that P(t(X)) and their properties: if biased, consistent, efficient
- Estimation/a Statistic: theta_hat (a way to summarise and synthetise data)

Draw a diagram between sample and population. 

The point of statistics: change our opinion about the action we have (or phenomenon we want to understand) to take in the face of evidence.

One big problem is if we got the model right for our use-case and phenomena. A wrong model choice leads to wrong conclusions. It should be informed as much by stats as by the theory and domain. Think of this in the spirit of the scientific method.

## Case Study: De Moivre on US Schooling

Let's remember what we discusssed last time. So, the US gov, tried to find out what makes some schools better than others. They saw that in top schools, small ones were dominating (in terms of nr students, perf. being SAT ~ Norm()). 

They decided to split up big schools into smaller ones. Can you say if it was a good, bad idea and why did they think that?

Students hypothesis:
- more attention to students in smaller classrooms
- private schools, where families are more wealthy
- geographical location, i.e. small towns and villages
- motivation of the underdog, from small towns
- friendships, community and peer competition (easier in smaller schools)
- self-selection: what kind of students go into small schools -- we assume average IQ is the same, including the distribution. Assume random allocation. 
- Skewed (even if not, longer tails): meaning, asymmetric distributions. 
- Finally: variance and standard deviation

About the decision sanity: reality vs data. The conservative decision is to do nothing, as restructuring costs a lot, in money and social changes & consequences, it is risky -- that is, the default action, without seeing any data or evidence, we would do nothing. 

S: A good remark about having a diversity, specializations (professional schools) -- can't have a one-size-fits-it-all policy. But we ignore it, oversimplifying the problem.

All of that is true, but just for 10 minutes, we introduce a (false) dichotomy between small and large schools. The alternative is to split big school -- remember, that outside this box, or bad framing of the problem, there are many many potential interventions (professor education, smaller classrooms, fairer allocation of students, raising up the disadvantaged hood schools). 

The punchline: we have all these factors potentially contributing to the performance. Because of DeMoivre and LLN (mean/sqrt(sd)) -- in a simulation, we notice the following thing: (insert graphs).

> Small schools will dominate both the top and bottom, due to larger variance. This is what it means. 

So, we go back to this idea that statistical models, are golemns, they do exactly what they are told to, and this is dangerous. We have to understand deeply in what contexts and in which ways these little robots fail and give absurd and invalid results without us knowing.

We will go into more detail next week in A/B testing and hypothesis testing, but here we go: once we have the default action and the alternative action, the null hypothesis is (sidenote, we don't care about rote calculation -- R packages does it for us, but we care about experiment design and decisions, try to figure out the causal influences):  in which worlds will I take the default actions (worlds, meaning the values of the unknown parameter of interest, describing the behavior of the populations -- in this case quantifying the impact of school size on SAT scores). The alternative hypothesis, is exactly the opposite, all the other worlds (parameter values) when I will take the alternative action.

So, in this case we will collect data, used to estimate the parameter and its confidence intervels (inference, with the idea of generalizing from the sample to the population). Now, given those confidence intervals, we ask how surprising it is to see the data/estimation, if the null hypothesis was true.

Most stats courses jump over these important aspects. Their starting point is: H0, HA are given, model is given, you just compute. In practice, even for experienced statistician, for a new problem, it is very hard to define those 4 components -- as it depends on the domain knowledge and business objectives. Moreover, even the interpretation of p-values is extremely tricky to communicate. We will develop tools to deal with those challenges. 

## Case Study: Chess example
I played chess for 14 years, professionally, question about difference in genders and what kind of tournaments and policies should we have. Why are there no women rn in top 100 (Historically, it was judit polgar in the top 20) ?

> Use this chance to extract data and analyse. Same problem with marathon runners (from BS big data). 

Causes?
- Bias: inferring natural ability -- nonsense from IQ research
- Misoginism
- Education and lack of encouragement
- Lack of opportunities, community, support
- Historical trajectory -- lack of competition

A lot is explained by how many boys and girls start from a given cohort/age. Similar problem, but slightly different -- for any problem of rank top(n).

We will discuss next time a whole range of other pitfalls, including spurious correlation (nicolas cage and drowning), common cause (babies and storks), ommited variables, mediation, selection bias, reverse causality, even including predictors which shouldn't be there. We need a statistical reasoning for all of these potential pitfalls. 

> explore python cli app + scraping + arrow + duckdb, see the trajectories of players and so on (chess.com vs fide). For the trajectories, mention the idea of longitudinal data, survival models, growth models, mixed models -- because of the particularities of DGP and causal process 

> see the difference between ELO vs xbox true skill, how fast it converges to the true ability -- that is a model we can investigate. 

## Case Study: Amazon reviews and ratings
How do you choose 4.7 (300) vs 4.5 (2000) -- according to what bounds, agresti-coull, correction. What chance do you give those with a small sample size? What is the optimal strategy here?

- we can guide ourselfs with the quality and relevance of reviews
- is it representative? (also, outside the box)
- text summary

Q: What is the variance and distribution, it depends, also on our risk appetites (w.r.t.) volume or if is one time (e.g. buy shoes vs coffee shops -- repeated interactions).

Introduce the confusion matrix, which will be discussed at length in ML and hypothesis testing (types of error) -- the point is that sometimes the payoff for correct decison or a mistake is asymmetric. And that matters (fraud vs reco quality) -- so, that is context-dependent. 

> good applications for text mining, statistical tests

## ML is a geocentric model of the universe

The good news is that sometimes, you just need a reliable prediction, as you're not intervening in the system causing a certain phenomena -- and by retraining ML models you can adapt to minor changes introduced by our interventions. Those ML models, they clearly didn't figure out a scientific explanation of the causal process, e.g. for demand forecasting in uber, and that just the prediction to be used in a larger ecosystem and environment for decision-making. 

Again, that is appropriate in low-stakes, large scale decisons. You might not care so much about the latent, causal process; but of course, you care that it generalizes to the population of interest (that is, a binding contract, a boundary in which your predictions are valid -- if you go outside that range, can easily get absurd predictions -- this is why this kind of system needs checks-and-balances, boxes to constrain the artificial stupidity). It is extraordinarily unlikely that these models translate to novel situations and environments without explicit transfer learning and careful adaptation.
