# Business School: Study Guide

In the study guide we go into more details and granularity -- with references, readings, and practices for particular topics within each lecture. Keep in mind the [course philosophy](../philosophy.qmd), which will help you in how to approach the study of a complicated subject and refer to ["Why did you study all of that?"](prerequisites.qmd) if I invoke a certain prerequisite and you feel rusty.

Some lectures are conceptual and you might go into more depth by reading. Some are highly technical and you want to go through the math and practice/code on suggested case-studies.

## Introduction and Course Philosophy

First, make sure you read the [introduction](../index.qmd#module-1-business-school-for-data-scientists) for a motivation and brief summary of what are we going to study, then review the [schedule and syllabus](roadmap.qmd#module-i-business-school-for-data-scientists) in order to understand how the course can be structured in particular lectures. 

- Understand the particularities of decision-making in the business environment
- Why I prefer "decision science" over "data science"
- Necessary admin stuff and [project requirements](../index.qmd#full-stack-data-apps). Think about your goals, aspirations, interests and hobbies, so that you can pick a fun use-case
- For a survey of applications and **use-cases in various domains**, [read here](1_applications.qmd).

## Decisions and Strategy in Business Context

I build upon the previous lecture to develop the story of decisions in a business environment. We need additional terminology, concepts, and models in order to structure the problem space. What is key here, is to get immersed and **put yourself in the shoes** of decision-makers. Read the [second chapter](2_performance_strategy.qmd).

- Evolution of firm's performance in time. Why, Where, How? [^strat-dyn]
    - Status quo, desired, and feared trajectories. 
    - Tradeoffs and limited resources, SWOT Analysis
- What is strategy? What makes good or bad strategy? [^perils-strat]
- Business Analyst's Workflow
- What is a Value Chain? Data Science Strategy Safari [^strat-safari]

[^strat-dyn]: Read Kim Warren's article on "The Dynamics of Strategy" [here](https://strategydynamics.com/free/assets/The%20Dynamics%20of%20Strategy,%202016.pdf)

[^perils-strat]: Read the article published in McKinsey by Richard Rumelt ["The perils of bad strategy"](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-perils-of-bad-strategy)

[^strat-safari]: Read about the framework of aligning business objectives to data science use-cases. Data Science Strategy Safari at [bayesianquest](https://bayesianquest.com/2018/11/13/data-science-strategy-safari-aligning-data-science-strategy-to-org-strategy/)

## Case-Study: LRB Subscriptions

Take a subscription-based publication like [London Review of Books](https://www.lrb.co.uk/), and analyze it using the tools and frameworks you learned in the course. Think about acquisition, churn, printing, transportation, and market share. How can it grow? What would make it profitable?

## Case-Study: Food Stamps and Fermi Estimation

There is a good reason why management consultants practice Fermi Estimation (sanity, order-of-magnitude checks) and it is asked in many interviews. Take a look at the case study on [Food Stamp Fraud](https://callingbullshit.org/case_studies/case_study_foodstamp_fraud.html) by Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West in Calling Bullshit.

## Decision-Making Under Uncertainty at Scale

In the previous lecture we learned how to better structure business problems and now it's time to bridge it with the subject matter of this course. Read the [third chapter](4_ml_stats.qmd).

- Clarify what I mean by AI and Cybernetics and the historical confusion
- When do we need Analytics vs Statistics vs Machine Learning?
- A note on interdisciplinarity and thinking in buckets
- Agents and Environments. Sources of Uncertainty

## Case-Study: DTC Fashion E-Commerces

Choose a direct-to-consumer e-commerce, like Zara, H&M, or a marketplace like Zalando (the big players in the oligopoly). How does a potential business strategy look like? What are some use-cases for Data Science / AI which can improve their outcomes?

## Case-Study: Uber and Dynamic Pricing

In the case of Uber, Bolt (ride sharing platforms), we're very much interested in same questions as before, however, we need to get a grasp on the idea of market-making. If you were to reverse-engineer the pricing algorithms, how would you go about doing it?
