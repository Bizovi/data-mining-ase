# Lab: tidyverse and ecosystem of packages: WIP

philosophy: not just load data, visualize and run models -- you did that plenty before. move to the idea of full stack data apps and problem framing and formulation through case studies.

Demo a full stack app from adore me, then explain the architecture, and what will we do at the labs.

## Setup and a discussion of the tech

- RMarkdown and Quarto
- tidyverse and ggplot
- arrow, duckdb and organizing the files
- renv and reproducibility
