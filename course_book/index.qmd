## Welcome to the course! {.unnumbered}

This is an introductory, big picture graduate course which bridges the gap between theory and practice, **cultivating the skills and understanding** necessary to bring value to organisations by **improving decision-making**. It is an attempt to find a golden mean of both worlds:

-   Illuminating theoretical ideas (contemplating in the library)
-   Practicing battle-tested technologies (engineering in the trenches).

The best advice I ever got as a novice data scientist was: **"Think of youself as a business person with superpowers"**. I'm attempting to reconcile that spirit of simplicity and elegance with advances in statistical thinking and engineering.

## Who should read this book?

> Anyone lost, confused, stuck or overwhelmed by Data Science and Machine Learning complexities, who wants to see the big picture and the possibilities

If you stumbled upon this e-book, you're probably a student in **Business Analytics** at Bucharest' Academy of Economic Sciences -- well, because I shamelessly promoted it.

Maybe, you're an **engineer** getting curious about ML or an **analyst** with a knack for the business, looking to improve your workflow and expand the quantitative toolbox. Maybe you're a **product manager** or an **entrepreneur** who wants to infuse AI into your startup.
:::

This is the **course I wish I had** when starting my journey in data science, which would prepare me for the realities of the industry, often very different from the academic world. At the same time, this is NOT a bootcamp: it is not enough by itself to land you a job, which requires lots of practice and extra study.

To the service of understanding, it becomes quite abstract and conceptual at times, but I hope you bear with me until you see the benefits of those abstractions. Think of it as a skeleton, a **conceptual frame**[^index-1] which ties together everything you have learned so far and can be built upon as you progress in your carreer and studies.

[^index-1]: This course stands on the "shoulders of giants", and I can only aspire to get to the level of clarity and rigor provided by [Hastie/Tibshirani](https://www.statlearning.com/) or [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/courses/). However, there is too much content out there, and the roadmap provided here should help you navigate it and find the shortest path towards better decisions in your firm.

## Why should you care?

You might've heard that data scientist is the sexiest job of 21st century, that AI is going to take over repetitive jobs, Deep Reinforcement Learning models are beating people at Dota and Chess, solving almost-impossible protein-folding problems. But what does it actually mean, if we step outside the hype and buzzwords, use a plain language, and apply these ideas in a more down-to-earth, day-to-day problems and challenges in businesses?

Over the past 3 years, you've probably been tortured by (or enjoyed) linear algebra, mathematical analysis, probability and statistics, operations research, differential equations, mathematical economics and cybernetics, algorithms and data structures, databases, object-oriented programming, econometrics and so on.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Why study all of this?

We live in a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world,[^index-2] but we still have to make decisions. Those decisions will bring better outcomes if they are informed by understanding the causal processes, driven by evidence and robust predictions. For a more complete explanation, read [here](01_fundamentals/background.qmd#why-did-you-study-all-of-that).

I want you to take away ONE thing, that is AI and Data Science in Businesses boils down to: **Decision-Making under Uncertainty at Scale**
:::

[^index-2]: [VUCA: a mental model to better understand the world](https://www.vuca-world.org/where-does-the-term-vuca-come-from/)

It can be a function of decision-making support or the system/product itself, like in the case of Uber, Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, Google and many others. Even if you are not a data scientist, you will work with them in one form or another *(Quant, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, ML Engineer, Data/BI Engineer, Decision-Maker, Domain Expert)*. Therefore, you have to understand their language, what are they doing, how to ask and make sure they solve the right problem for you.

> When somebody asks you what have you learned in this book and course, I suggest two metaphors:[^index-3] one of simplification and another of seeing relations

[^index-3]: Due to my recent philosophical readings, some of the language here has a very specific meaning, which is totally outside the scope. For the curious, I will write a few blog posts outlining some philosophical arguments which struck a chord in me and which I found tremenously useful in day-to-day life.

## Cybernetics Done Right

::: callout-warning
The idea behind **Cybernetics** curriculum is great: an **interdisciplinary** approach to solving complex economic problems, that is what we know today as **weak/specialised AI**[^index-4].

Unfortunately, the execution is extremely difficult to pull off without a consistent vision, expertise and an account of recent developments. It is even more difficult to put those 80's models in practice, especially in a data-driven age.
:::

[^index-4]: Or data science, if you wish -- at the intersection of computer science, domain expertise (economics), statistics and mathematics. We will dive in more detail and nuance in our first lectures.

Let's go back to the burning question: what I wish I had in a course? It is hard to teach these topics in a way which is both theoretically sound and can be immediately applied.

After recognizing that there is no silver bullet, my conclusion is that following the principles outlined below consistently, dramatically increases the chances of preparing a new generation ready to tackle the messy, ill-defined problems we encounter.

-   Provide motivation for **why** something is important (a field, theory, model, method, technology)
-   Discuss **practical applications** and challenges the firms face, from an insider's perspective. Those are our case-studies.
    - First, we try to deeply understand the problem and frame it in "our" language, that is, clarify and reduce ambiguity
    - Then, we strip the problem to the simplest model, to illuminate some key aspect, like pricing and demand planning decisions. Then, and only then we bring back all the realism and complexities.
    - Applications are based on realistic or real data, which can be messy, hard to access, biased and incomplete
    - Coding up the solutions and software implementations, with the real-world challenges of deploying models and improving decision making
-   Develop a **conceptual undestanding**, an intuition about the problem and the "tool" we think is appropriate in tackling it:
    -   Present the tool theoretically rigorous and sound, but **only where it matters**. More geometry and graphs over equations, more simulations and stories over proofs.
    -   Leverage previous mathematical, statistical, and domain knowledge
    -   For the mathematically inclined, add some elements of abstract math to understand the underlying foundations of these methods and models
-   Use **simulations** as a safe playground [^index-5] that we control, to get a feel for the behavior of models and algorithms.
    -   Implement those in code using best practices, as an engineering exercise
    -   With lots of visualization, especially interactive ones


[^index-5]: I often find myself truly understanding something, only after I code it up and understand the "mechanics" (of a model) well, then try to think of how I would apply it in practice, in different contexts. This hints to the idea that we need some complementary background and tools, some of them right from the beginning of higher education.

Speaking about the **prerequisites**, there are some tools we have to dust off the shelves and cultivate an appreciation of their importance: linear algebra, calculus, probability theory and mathematical statistics. Not least, a confident handle of a programming language like Python or R is essential, such that we can focus on what truly matters.

::: {.column-margin}
Those prerequisites are placed in context of the business practice, with swift reviews and references to resources which should fill in all the gaps.
:::

At the same time, we have to gradually get **rid of the bad habits** that were accumulated: analyses which can't be reproduced, mechanically following a statistical procedure (because the flowchart of statistical tests said so, for example), jumping to a conclusion (as if there is only one, correct, textbook answer), rushing the learning process, handwaving to cover for a poorly articulated argument. On the other side of the spectrum, perfectionism doesn't help either, as this field is inherently iterative and experimental.

[But we need to develop a set of processes to iterate and improve effectively]{.aside}

## Your Unorthodox Guide

Think of me as an industry expert,[^index-6] not an academic pushing you to do homework. Think of the course as a summer school or workshop, rather than required credits and another exam to pass.

[^index-6]: ![See one of my conference talks at BigDataWeek, intended for a mixed tech/business audience: [Pragmatic AI in Google Cloud Platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02NPR_nDaxQ)](01_fundamentals/img/me.jpeg "Reality"){width="90%"}

I'm a generalist -- navigating uncertainty and complexity to improve decision-making at scale with data and domain-driven software. Here are a few relevant facts about me:

-   Graduate of Cybernetics (2017) and Quantitative Economics (2019)
    -   Did some research in Complex Systems, Agent-Based Modeling, Systems' Dynamics, and Heterodox Economics, which was lots of fun
    -   My serious work was at the intersection of Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning (thesis, dissertation)
-   Head of Data Science at AdoreMe Tech, with the firm since 2016
    -   Lingerie e-commerce in the U.S., with a PAYG, subscription and try-at-home business models
    -   \$250m revenue in 2022, acquired by Victoria's Secret
    -   70 tech people in Bucharest, over 300 employees
    -   My work involves AI Strategy, Product Management, ML Systems Design
-   Some typical applications of AI in an e-commerce I contributed to:[^experience]
    -   Demand Planning and Inventory Optimization systems to prevent lost sales and excess inventory
    -   Recommender Systems to help users find relevant, personalized items and bundles
    -   Marketing optimizations in Acquisition/Advertisement, Engagement, CRM, Merchandising, Pricing and Promotion
-   Hobbies: 
    -   Reading about "Philosophy as a Way of Life" & Cognitive Science
    -   Painting, Hiking, Jazz/Classical/Metal 
    -   Played chess professionally, but that much stress isn't worth it

[^experience]: I find the idea of "Skin in the Game" very appealing. Therefore, a lot of attention will be given to the **pitfalls**, what can go wrong and what I learned from past mistakes, so that you don't have to repeat them.

[Unfortunately, I have none of the answers of how does Intelligence, Rationality, Wisdom contribute to meaning in life -- at best, some plausible hypotheses]{.aside}

Unsurprisingly, there will be lots of painting metaphors when it comes to simplicity, and cognitive science references when talking about ways in which we're biased and foolish. Chess, of course, inspires analogies of competition, strategy, and tactics to its service. 

## Course Roadmap

We start the course with a first module, in which we explore the context of data science in businesses, figure out what does AI mean, and where is it useful. Then, we review important statisical concepts and tools, exapting/repurposing them for our objectives, while remembering the hell we needed those in the first place.

Next, we move on to A/B testing and towards a mindset of causal inference. Once you get a taste of decisions with high stakes, we switch to a predictive, Machine Learning perspective and walk through our workhorse models, which should serve us decades ahead in a wide range of applications: both predictive and exploratory.

Did you get comfortable with ML? Good, because it's time to acknowledge the limitations and get more powerful tools from causal inference, when A/B tests and randomised experiments are unfeasible or unethical, but we can leverage naturally-occuring experiments. This is truly challenging: it is an art and science, in contrast with the auto-magic pattern recognition of ML. It requires deep thinking and understanding.

The icing on the cake is miscellaneous topics dear to me and usually not covered in such a course: Demand Forecasting, Recommender Systems, and Natural Language Processing. All extremely useful in business contexts, but significant tweaks are needed to the models discussed before.

If you ask what is that engineering branch, you're totally right! During the labs we'll build from the ground up a tech stack for reproducible data analysis, model and data pipelines, culminating in a full-stack data app (with user interface, backend, database), which solves a real-world problem.

That is your final project for the course and something you can brag about in your portfolio and github profile. It sounds complicated, but we have the tools to make it easy for us. Don't worry about getting everything right, but focus on a problem and single area from the course you're passionate about: be it data visualization, ML, statistics or sheer engineering curiosity.
