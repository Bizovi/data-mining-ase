[Mihai Bizovi](about_me.qmd) | Head of Data Science \@AdoreMe

This website emerges out of teaching data science to students of various backgrounds and my practice in the industry as an engineer and leader.

I aspire to contribute to the understanding of this complex landscape and teach people how to navigate it, how to develop **valuable skills**, and become more **effective at problem-solving**. To achieve this, we need to master "the fundamentals."

I believe that improving **decision-making** is the reason why we practice AI. We mostly forgot that as teachers. We're also getting increasingly specialized, let's say, in Deep Learning -- which makes us miss the interdisciplinary, big picture.

## Decision-Making for the Brave and True {.unnumbered}

This is an introductory, big picture, free and open-source course which bridges the gap between theory and practice, **cultivating the skills and understanding** necessary to bring value to organisations by **improving decision-making**. It is an attempt to find a golden mean of both worlds:

-   Illuminating theoretical ideas (contemplating in the library)
-   Practicing battle-tested technologies (engineering in the trenches).

The best advice I ever got as a novice data scientist was: **"Think of youself as a business person with superpowers"**. I'm attempting to reconcile that spirit of simplicity and elegance with advances in statistical thinking and engineering.

## Who should read this book?

*Anyone lost, confused, stuck or overwhelmed by Data Science and Machine Learning complexities, who wants to see the big picture, a path forward, and the possibilities.*

If you stumbled upon this website, you're probably a student in Business Analytics, or know me personally -- well, because I shamelessly promoted it.

Maybe, you're an **engineer** getting curious about ML or an **analyst** with a knack for the business, looking to improve your workflow and expand the quantitative toolbox. Maybe you're a **product manager** or an **entrepreneur** who wants to infuse AI into your startup.

In my opinion, junior data scientists and ML practitioners a few years into their journey will benefit the most from the re-contextualization of fundamentals that I'm doing here, which could enable them to take another **leap in career**.
:::

This is the **course I wish I had** when starting my journey in data science, which would prepare me for the realities of the industry, often very different from the academic world. In my teaching, I achieve this by putting business decisions, understanding the domain, and working software at the forefront of each (statistical) tool we learn. 

The course is challenging due to its breath and depth. At the same time, this is NOT a bootcamp: it is not enough by itself to land you a job, which requires lots of practice and extra study.  To the service of understanding, it becomes quite abstract and conceptual at times, but I hope you bear with me until you see the benefits of those abstractions.

Think of it as a skeleton, a **conceptual frame**[^index-1] which ties together everything you have learned so far and can be built upon as you progress in your career and studies. You will probably go back to the same idea after years, with greater wisdom and skill -- to unlock its real power.

[^index-1]: This course stands on the shoulders of giants, and I can only aspire to get to the level of clarity and rigor provided by [Hastie/Tibshirani](https://www.statlearning.com/) or [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/courses/) when it comes to ML, and [Richard McElreath](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) or [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/) on Bayesian Statistics / Causal Inference.

## Overwhelming amount of content. What is best for learning?

Given the over-abundance of learning resources, it is too much to sift through a hundred pages of Coursera in the data science section, books, and tutorials to find the optimal ones. Inevitably, there is so much bullshit and repetition.

The [roadmap](#what-will-you-learn) provided here should help you navigate it and find the shortest path towards developing your skills and better decisions in your firm. Pick a module you're passionate about, for example, Bayesian Statistics and look in the [resources](references.qmd) page for a guide where to start reading and practicing.
:::

## Why should you care?

You might've heard that data scientist is the sexiest job of 21st century, that AI is going to take over repetitive jobs, Deep Reinforcement Learning models are beating people at Go, Dota, Chess, solving almost-impossible protein-folding problems. The world is awash in the newest ChatGPT and Midjourney frenzy, with new developments every month and week.

## How do I keep up?

You don't, at least if you want to have a balanced life. That's why I choose to focus on fundamentals which stood the test of time, which are anyways a prerequisite before you dive into understanding the technicalities of those cutting-edge models and systems.

You will be surprised how far can you go with simple, even linear models. In the end, it is not a competition, nor am I against deep learning: we learn to solve a very different class of problems that businesses encounter.
:::

But what does it actually mean, if we step outside the hype and buzzwords, use a plain language, and apply these ideas in a more down-to-earth, day-to-day problems and challenges in businesses?

In university years, you've probably been tortured by (or enjoyed) linear algebra, mathematical analysis, probability and statistics, operations research, differential equations, mathematical economics and cybernetics, algorithms and data structures, databases, object-oriented programming, econometrics and so on.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Why study all of this?

We live in a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world,[^index-2] but we still have to make decisions. Those decisions will bring better outcomes if they are informed by understanding the causal processes, driven by evidence and robust predictions. For a more in-depth explanation of the essence of each subject/domain, read [here](01_fundamentals/prerequisites.qmd).

I want you to take away ONE thing, that is "AI" and Data Science in Businesses boils down to: **Decision-Making under Uncertainty at Scale**
:::

[^index-2]: [VUCA: a mental model to better understand the world](https://www.vuca-world.org/where-does-the-term-vuca-come-from/)

It can be a function of decision-making support or the system/product itself, like in the case of Uber, Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, Google and many others. Even if you are not a data scientist, you will work with them in one form or another *(Quant, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, ML Engineer, Data/BI Engineer, Decision-Maker, Domain Expert)*. Therefore, you have to understand their language, what are they doing, how to ask and make sure they solve the right problem for you.

> When somebody asks you what have you learned in this book and course, I suggest two metaphors:[^index-3] one of simplification and another of seeing relations

[^index-3]: Due to my philosophical readings, some of the language here has a very specific meaning, which is totally outside the scope. For the curious, I will write a few blog posts outlining some philosophical arguments which struck a chord in me and which I found tremenously useful in day-to-day life.

## What will you learn?

I always start with the first module, in which we explore [decisions](01_fundamentals/background.qmd) in businesses, figure out what does AI mean, and where it adds value. If we view statistics as **changing our minds and actions in the face of evidence** -- fundamental statistical concepts and tools will shine in a new light. It will become clear why those models and methodologies were invented in the first place.

- [**Module 1**](01_fundamentals/roadmap.qmd): Business Decisions and Probability Fundamentals
- [**Module 2a**](02_causality/roadmap.qmd): Applied Bayesian Statistics
- [**Module 2b**](02_causality/roadmap_abtest.qmd): Hypothesis Formulation and A/B Testing[^r3]
- **Module 2c**: Causal Inference with Directed Acyclic Graphs
- [**Module 3a**](03_ml/roadmap.qmd): Probabilistic Machine Learning
- **Module 3b**: Deep Learning and Special Topics
- [**Projects**](04_engineering/roadmap.qmd): Software Engineering and Full-Stack Data Apps

[^r3]: ![ We will see that formulating a hypothesis is an art in itself, and that experiment design in practice is fascinating and complicated, full of pitfalls and dangers. That's not your stats 101! *(Source: [McElreath](https://youtu.be/KNPYUVmY3NM))*](01_fundamentals/img/meme-causal.jpeg){width="90%"}


These fundamentals are not "just theory", it is what will make or break our project in practice. We will achieve a lot with simple, elegant models; appreciate the importance of asking the right questions, persuasive communication, and storytelling with data. That's why it's essential to take every tool, and **apply** it in the context of an appropriate use-case/application -- meaning, **we'll code a lot**.


::: {.callout-tip}
## Go to "Resources" page for practice!

Conceptual understanding by itself is not enough. So, I curated a [list of resources](references.qmd) to practice on interesting case-studies, datasets, which directly apply the models, tools, and methodologies presented. These are written by experts in the field, are usually well thought, easy to follow, reproducible, and highlight important aspects of a problem and model.

Also, keep an eye on the course [github repo](https://github.com/Bizovi/decision-making), in which we'll do some exciting projects (full stack data apps) and investigate common problems/challenges with a fresh perspective.
:::

Once we have a confident grasp of the fundamentals, we continue with understanding and applying Bayesian Statistics. It is an extremely flexible and composable approach to building explainable models of increasing complexity and realism. To put it bluntly, it will enable us to improve on most challenges in decision-making that businesses face. 

Did you get comfortable with building custom statistical models for inference and prediction? For decisions with high stakes, we often want to do controlled experiments. We'll develop a rigorous methodology for designing and performing A/B tests, learn how to recognize and avoid pitfalls that it's so easy to fall into.


Often, A/B tests and randomised experiments are unfeasible or unethical. We also acknowledged the limitations of inferring an association[^caus1], so it's time to get more powerful tools from causal inference. We can leverage natural experiments. This is truly challenging: it is an art and science, in contrast with the auto-magic pattern recognition of ML. It requires deep thinking and understanding. 

[^caus1]: Realize that we cannot reach a causal conclusion from observational data alone. We need a theory, which is our understanding of how the "world" works -- translated into a statistical model, plus data, which will give us new insight into the causal processes (the evidence).


::: {.callout-important}
## What if I care only about ML?

Even if you're interested only in machine learning, most practitioners will emphasize the importance of mastering regression (generalized linear models) and doing A/B tests to gather evidence that our new model brings an improvement. 

This is how we jump through various buckets, highlighting the golden thread linking them all: decisions and uncertainty. Moreover, the tools we learned in Bayesian Statistics are directly applicable in ML -- the lines between these two fields are indeed very blurry.
:::

Often, we care not just about a single decision or developing better policies, but we have to make tons of little decisions at scale. This is when we switch to a predictive, Machine Learning perspective and walk through our workhorse models, which should serve us decades ahead in a wide range of applications: both predictive and exploratory.

During the labs we'll build from the ground up a tech stack for reproducible data analysis, model and data pipelines, culminating in a full-stack data app (with user interface, backend, database), which solves a real-world problem.

## Build an impressive project for your portfolio

That is your final project for the course[^proj] and something you can brag about in your portfolio and github profile. It sounds complicated, but we have the tools to make it easy for us. Don't worry about getting everything right, but focus on a problem and single area from the course you're passionate about: be it data visualization, ML, statistics or sheer engineering curiosity. 
:::

[^proj]: A project can be much simpler: a quarto blog to showcase your research, a python package and CLI application to train a model, a streamlit app to demo a model.

The icing on the cake is miscellaneous topics dear to me and usually not covered in such a course: Demand Forecasting, Recommender Systems, and Natural Language Processing. All extremely useful in business contexts, but significant tweaks are needed to the models discussed before.
