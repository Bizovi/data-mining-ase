## ~whoami: as engineer and leader

**At my day job,** I'm a generalist -- navigating uncertainty and complexity to improve decision-making at scale. I really believe in the idea of "skin in the game"

## ~whoami: as teacher and researcher

**As a teacher,** I aspire to contribute to the understanding of AI's complex landscape; how to navigate it, develop valuable skills, and become more effective at problem-solving.

## ~whoami: as a person

**As a person,** I aspire to a life of wisdom and meaning, towards the good, true, and beautiful. Learning how to be present and deeply understanding reality.


- Cultivating wisdom -- commitment to philosophy as a way of life
- Painting as a craft, creative expression, and therapy. Learning about art history and art appreciation in multiple media (music, film, painting)
- Reading about cognitive science, evolution, history, and economics
- Hiking, hipster coffee, 14 years of pro-ish chess


## How does it fit together?

On another note, my interests in AI, art, cognitive science, and philosophy have an aspect of science, craft, worldview, and deep participation, engagement. Moreover, they are deeply interconnected and I would even say, **synoptically integrated**. It is important to me that these conceptual frames fit into a coherent whole and contribute in a practical way towards a good life.


I can't emphasise enough the importance of different levels of "knowing": propositional, procedural, perspectival, and participatory -- as it is not enough to know the facts (or have beliefs), but to know how to do something, to have a perspective of the "world" and a sense of participation in whatever you're engaged in. 

I mean that we're **agents** in different **arenas** of life and the sense of meaning comes from an **attunement** to those arenas. We participate in a course of something, which has impact on the environment, which changes us and how we view and relate to the world, self and others.


[Unfortunately, I have none of the answers of how does Intelligence, Rationality, Wisdom contribute to meaning in life -- at best, some plausible hypotheses]{.aside}

Unsurprisingly, there will be lots of painting metaphors when it comes to simplicity, and cognitive science references when talking about ways in which we're biased and foolish. Chess, of course, inspires analogies of competition, strategy, and tactics to its service.
